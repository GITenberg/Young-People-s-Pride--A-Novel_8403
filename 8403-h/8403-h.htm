TO ROSEMARY

  If I were sly, I'd steal for you that cobbled hill, Montmartre,
  Josephine's embroidered shoes, St. Louis' oriflamme,
  The river on grey evenings and the bluebell-glass of Chartres,
  And four sarcastic gargoyles from the roof of Notre Dame.

  That wouldn't be enough, though, enough nor half a part;
  There'd be shells because they're sorrowful, and pansies since
  they're wise,
  The smell of rain on lilac-bloom, less fragrant than your heart,
  And that small blossom of your name, as steadfast as your
  eyes.

  Sapphires, pirates, sandalwood, porcelains, sonnets, pearls,
  Sunsets gay as Joseph's coat and seas like milky jade,
  Dancing at your birthday like a mermaid's dancing curls
  &mdash;If my father'd only brought me up to half a decent trade!

  Nothing I can give you&mdash;nothing but the rhymes&mdash;
  Nothing but the empty speech, the idle words and few,
  The mind made sick with irony you helped so many times,
  The strengthless water of the soul your truthfulness kept true.

  Take the little withered things and neither laugh nor cry
  &mdash;Gifts to make a sick man glad he's going out like sand&mdash;
  They and I are yours, you know, as long as there's an I.
  Take them for the ages. Then they may not shame your
  hand.

  &ldquo;... For there groweth in great abundance
  in this land a small flower, much blown about
  by winds, named 'Young People's Pride'...&rdquo;

    <h2>
      I
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is one of Johnny Chipman's parties at the Harlequin Club, and as usual
      the people the other people have been asked to meet are late and as usual
      Johnny is looking hesitatingly around at those already collected with the
      nervous kindliness of an absent-minded menagerie-trainer who is trying to
      make a happy family out of a wombat, a porcupine, and two small Scotch
      terriers because they are all very nice and he likes them all and he can't
      quite remember at the moment just where he got hold of any of them. This
      evening he has been making an omelet of youngest. K. Ricky French, the
      youngest Harvard playwright to learn the tricks of C43, a Boston
      exquisite, impeccably correct from his club tie to the small gold animal
      on his watch-chain, is almost coming to blows with Slade Wilson, the
      youngest San Francisco cartoonist to be tempted East by a big paper and
      still so new to New York that no matter where he tries to take the subway,
      he always finds himself buried under Times Square, over a question as to
      whether La Perouse or Foyot's has the best <i>hors-d'oeuvres</i> in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conflict is taking place across Johnny's knees, both of which are
      being used for emphasis by the disputants till he is nearly mashed like a
      sandwich-filling between two argumentative slices of bread, but he is
      quite content. Peter Piper, the youngest rare-book collector in the
      country, who, if left to himself, would have gravitated naturally toward
      French and a devastating conversation in monosyllables on the pretty
      failings of prominent débutantes, is gradually warming Clark Stovall, the
      youngest star of the Provincetown Players out of a prickly silence,
      employed in supercilious blinks at all the large pictures of celebrated
      Harlequins by discreet, intelligent questions as to the probable future of
      Eugene O'Neill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stovall has just about decided to throw Greenwich Village omniscience
      overboard and admit privately to himself that people like Peter can be
      both human and interesting even if they do live in the East Sixties
      instead of Macdougal Alley when a page comes in discreetly for Johnny
      Chipman. Johnny rises like an agitated blond robin who has just spied the
      very two worms he was keeping room for to top off breakfast. &ldquo;Well&rdquo; he
      says to the world at large. &ldquo;They're only fifteen minutes late apiece this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He darts out into the hall and reappears in a moment, a worm on either
      side. Both worms will fit in easily with the youthful assortment already
      gathered&mdash;neither can be more than twenty-five.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver Crowe is nearly six feet, vividly dark, a little stooping, dressed
      like anybody else in the Yale Club from hair parted in the middle to low
      heavyish brown shoes, though the punctured patterns on the latter are a
      year or so out of date. There is very little that is remarkable about his
      appearance except the round, rather large head that shows writer or
      pugilist indifferently, brilliant eyes, black as black warm marble under
      heavy tortoise-shell glasses and a mouth that is not weak in the least but
      somehow burdened by a pressure upon it like a pressure of wings, the
      pressure of that kind of dream which will not release the flesh it
      inhabits always and agonizes often until it is given perfect body and so
      does not release it until such flesh has ceased. At present he is not the
      youngest anything, except, according to himself 'the youngest failure in
      advertising,' but a book of nakedly youthful love-poetry, which in gloomy
      moments he wishes had never been written, although the <i>San Francisco
      Warbler</i> called it as 'tensely vital as the Shropshire Lad,' brought
      him several column reviews and very nearly forty dollars in cash at
      twenty-one and since then many people of his own age and one or two
      editors have considered him &ldquo;worth watching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted Billett is dark too, but it is a ruddy darkness with high clear color
      of skin. He could pass anywhere as a College Senior and though his clothes
      seem to have been put on anyhow with no regard for pressing or tailoring
      they will always raise a doubt in the minds of the uninstructed as to
      whether it is not the higher carelessness that has dictated them rather
      than ordinary poverty&mdash;a doubt that, in many cases, has proved
      innocently fortunate for Ted. His hands are a curious mixture of square
      executive ability and imaginative sensitiveness and his surface manners
      have often been described as 'too snotty' by delicate souls toward whom
      Ted was entirely unconscious of having acted with anything but the most
      disinterested politeness. On the other hand a certain even-tempered
      recklessness and capacity for putting himself in the other fellow's place
      made him one of the few popularly lenient officers to be obeyed with
      discipline in his outfit during the war. As regards anything Arty or
      Crafty his attitude is merely appreciative&mdash;he is finishing up his
      last year of law at Columbia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnny introduces Oliver and Ted to everybody but Peter&mdash;the three
      were classmates&mdash;shepherds his flock with a few disarmingly personal
      insults to prevent stiffness closing down again over the four that have
      already got to talking at the arrival of the two newcomers, and marshals
      them out to the terrace where they are to have dinner. Without seeming to
      try, he seats them so that Ted, Peter and Oliver will not form an
      offensive-defensive alliance against the three who are strangers to them
      by retailing New Haven anecdotes to each other for the puzzlement of the
      rest and starts the ball rolling with a neat provocative attack on
      romanticism in general and Cabell in particular.

    <h2>
      II
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny's strong for realism, aren't you, Johnny?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, Ted, I am. I think 'Main Street' and 'Three Soldiers' are two
      of the best things that ever happened to America. You can say it's
      propaganda&mdash;maybe it is, but at any rate it's real. Honestly, I've
      gotten so tired, we all have, of all this stuff about the small Middle
      Western Town being the backbone of the country&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Backbone? Last vertebra!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for 'Main Street,' it's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the hardest book to read through without fallin' asleep where you
      sit, though, that I've struck since the time I had to repeat Geology.&rdquo;
       Peter smiles. &ldquo;But, there, Johnny, I guess I'm the bone-head part of the
      readin' public&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's why you're just the kind of person that ought to read books like
      that, Peter. The reading public in general likes candy laxatives, I'll
      admit&mdash;Old Nest stuff&mdash;but you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Nobody else will ever have to write the description of a small Middle
      Western Town'&rdquo; quotes Oliver, discontentedly. &ldquo;Well, who ever wanted to
      write the description of a small Middle Western Town?&rdquo; and from Ricky
      French, selecting his words like flowers for a <i>boutonniere</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble with 'Main Street' is not that it isn't the truth but that it
      isn't nearly the whole truth. Now Sherwood Anderson&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tennyson. Who <i>was</i> Tennyson? He died young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if <i>that</i> is Clara Stratton's idea of how to play a woman who
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two sentences seem to come from no one and arrive nowhere. They are
      batted out of the conversation like toy balloons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bunny Andrews sailed for Paris Thursday,&rdquo; says Ted Billett longingly.
      &ldquo;Two years at the Beaux Arts,&rdquo; and for an instant the splintering of
      lances stops, like the hush in a tournament when the marshal throws down
      the warder, at the shine of that single word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, New York is the best place to be right now if you're going
      to do anything big,&rdquo; says Johnny uncomfortably, too much as if he felt he
      just had to believe in it, but the rest are silent, seeing the Seine wind
      under its bridges, cool as satin, grey-blue with evening, or the sawdust
      of a restaurant near the quais where one can eat Rabelaisiantly for six
      francs with wine and talk about anything at all without having to pose or
      explain or be defensive, or the chimneypots of La Cité branch-black
      against winter sky that is pallor of crimson when the smell of roast
      chestnuts drifts idly as a student along Boulevard St. Germain, or none of
      these, or all, but for each one nostalgic aspect of the city where good
      Americans go when they die and bad ones while they live&mdash;to
      Montmartre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New York <i>is</i> twice as romantic, really,&rdquo; says Johnny firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can't get out of it,&rdquo; adds Oliver with a twisted grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted Billett turns to Ricky French as if each had no other friend in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were over, weren't you?&rdquo; he says, a little diffidently, but his voice
      is that of Rachel weeping for her children.
    </p>

      The party has adjourned to Stovall's dog-kennel-sized apartment on West
      Eleventh Street with oranges and ice, Peter Piper having suddenly
      remembered a little place he knows where what gin is to be bought is
      neither diluted Croton water nor hell-fire. The long drinks gather
      pleasantly on the table, are consumed by all but Johnny, gather again. The
      talk grows more fluid, franker.

      Ricky French is getting a little drunk but it shows itself only in a
      desire to make every sentence unearthly cogent with perfect words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy marriage&mdash;ver' good&mdash;stimula-shion,&rdquo; he says, carefully
      but unsteadily, &ldquo;other thing&mdash;tosh!&rdquo;

      stuff, damn good. Too bad. Feenee. Why will they get married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation veers toward a mortuary discussion of love. Being young,
      nearly all of them are anxious for, completely puzzled by and rather
      afraid of it, all at the same time. They wish to draw up one logical code
      to cover its every variation; they look at it, as it is at present with
      the surprised displeasure of florists at a hollyhock that will come blue
      when by every law of variation it should be rose. It is only a good deal
      later that they will be able to give, not blasphemy because the rules of
      the game are always mutually inconsistent, but tempered thanks that there
      are any rules at all. Now Ricky French especially has the air of a

    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver is taking Ted out to Melgrove with him over Sunday for suburban
      fresh-air and swimming, so the two just manage to catch the 12.53 from the
      Grand Central, in spite of Slade Wilson's invitation to talk all night and
      breakfast at the Brevoort. They spend the rattling, tunnel-like passage to
      125th Street catching their breath again, a breath that seems to strike a
      florid gentlemen in a dirty collar ahead of them with an expression of
      permanent, sorrowful hunger. Then Ted remarks reflectively,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice gin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh-huh. Not floor varnish anyway like most of this prohibition stuff.
      What think of the people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Interesting but hardly conclusive. Liked the Wilson lad. Peter, of
      course, and Johnny. The French person rather young Back Bay, don't you
      think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver smiles. The two have been through Yale, some of the war and much of
      the peace together, and the fact has inevitably developed a certain
      quality of being able to talk to each other in shorthand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Groton plus Harvard&mdash;it always gets a little inhuman
      especially Senior year&mdash;but gin had a civilizing influence. Lucky
      devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baker's newest discovery&mdash;yes, it does sound like a patent medicine.
      Don't mean that, but he has a play on the road&mdash;sure-fire, Johnny
      says&mdash;Edward Sheldon stuff&mdash;Romance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Young Harvard Romantic. An Essay Presented to the Faculty of Yale
      University by Theodore Billett for the Degree of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard anything about your novel, Oliver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to see my pet Mammon of Unrighteousness about it in a couple of
      weeks. Oh <i>Lord!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Present&mdash;not voting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be cheap, Ted. If I could only make some money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody says that there is money in advertising,&rdquo; Ted quotes
      maliciously. &ldquo;Where <i>have</i> I heard that before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;That's</i> what anybody says about anything till they try it. Well,
      there is&mdash;but not in six months for a copy-writer at Vanamee and Co.
      Especially when the said copy-writer has to have enough to marry on.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
      will write novels when he ought to be reading, 'How I Sold America on
      Ossified Oats' like a good little boy. Young people are <i>so</i>
      impatient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good Lord, Ted, we've been engaged eight months already and we
      aren't getting any furtherer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember the copybooks, my son. The love of a pure, good woman and the
      one-way pocket&mdash;that's what makes the millionaires. Besides, look at
      Isaac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm no Isaac. And Nancy isn't Rebekah, praises be! But it is an&mdash;emotional
      strain. On both of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all you have to do is sell your serial rights. After that&mdash;pie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. The trouble is, I can see it so plain if everything happens right&mdash;and
      then&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted is not very consoling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People get funny ideas about each other when they aren't close by. Even
      when they're in love,&rdquo; he says rather darkly; and then, for no apparent
      reason, &ldquo;Poor Billy. See it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver has, unfortunately&mdash;the announcement that the engagement
      between Miss Flavia Marston of Detroit and Mr. William Curting of New York
      has been broken by mutual consent was an inconspicuous little paragraph in
      the morning papers. &ldquo;That was all&mdash;just funny ideas and being away.
      And then this homebred talent came along,&rdquo; Ted muses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you're the hell of a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted suddenly jerks into consciousness of what he has been saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo; he says, completely apologetic, &ldquo;didn't mean a word I said, just
      sorry for Billy, poor guy. 'Fraid it'll break him up pretty bad at first.&rdquo;
       This seems to make matters rather worse and he changes the subject
      abruptly. &ldquo;How's Nancy?&rdquo; he asks with what he hopes seems disconnected
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy? All right. Hates St. Louis, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should think she might, this summer. Pretty hot there, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Says it's like a wet furnace. And her family's bothering her some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um, too bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>I</i> don't mind. But it's rotten for her. They don't see the
      point exactly&mdash;don't know that I blame them. She could be in Paris,
      now&mdash;that woman was ready to put up the money. My fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she seems to like things better the way they are&mdash;God knows
      why, my antic friend! If it were <i>my</i> question between you and a year
      studying abroad! Not that you haven't your own subtle attractions, Ollie.&rdquo;
       Ted has hoped to irritate Oliver into argument by the closing remark, but
      the latter only accepts it with militant gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've done her out of that, too,&rdquo; he says abysmally, &ldquo;as well as
      sticking her in St. Louis while I stay here and can't even drag down
      enough money to support her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ollie, snap out of it! That's only being dramatic. You know darn well
      you will darn soon. I'll be saying 'bless you, my children, increase and
      multiply,' inside a month if your novel goes through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If! Oh well. Oh hell. I think I've wept on your shoulder long enough for
      tonight, Ted. Tell me your end of it&mdash;things breaking all right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted's face sets into lines that seem curiously foreign and aged for the
      smooth surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;you know my trouble,&rdquo; he brings out at last with some
      difficulty. &ldquo;You ought to, anyhow&mdash;we've talked each other over too
      much when we were both rather planko for you not to. I'm getting along, I
      think. The work&mdash;<i>ca marche assez bien</i>. And the restlessness&mdash;can
      be stood. That's about all there is to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both are completely serious now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bon. Very glad,&rdquo; says Oliver in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can stand it. I was awful afraid I couldn't when I first got back. And
      law interests me, really, though I've lost three years because of the war.
      And I'm working like a pious little devil with a new assortment of damned
      and when you haven't any money you can't go on parties in New York unless
      you raise gravy riding to a fine art. Only sometimes&mdash;well, you know
      how it is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver nods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be sitting there, at night especially, in that little tin Tophet of
      a room on Madison Avenue, working. I <i>can</i> work, if I do say it
      myself&mdash;I'm hoping to get through with school in January, now. But it
      gets pretty lonely, sometimes when there's nobody to run into that you can
      really talk to&mdash;the people I used to play with in College are out of
      New York for the summer&mdash;even Peter's down at Southampton most of the
      time or out at Star Bay&mdash;you're in Melgrove&mdash;Sam Woodward's
      married and working in Chicago&mdash;Brick Turner's in New Mexico&mdash;I've
      dropped out of the Wall Street bunch in the class that hang out at the
      Yale Club&mdash;I'm posted there anyhow, and besides they've all made
      money and I haven't, and all they want to talk about is puts and calls.
      And then you remember things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time my pilot and I blew into Paris when we thought we were hitting
      somewhere around Nancy till we saw that blessed Eiffel Tower poking out of
      the fog. And the Hotel de Turenne on Rue Vavin and getting up in the
      morning and going out for a café cognac breakfast, and everything being
      amiable and pleasant, and kidding along all the dear little ladies that
      sat on the <i>terrasse</i> when they dropped in to talk over last
      evening's affairs. I suppose I'm a sensualist&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody is.&rdquo; from Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's another thing. Women. And love. Ollie, my son, you don't
      know how very damn lucky you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do, rather,&rdquo; says Oliver, a little stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't. Because I'd give everything I have for what you've got and all
      you can do is worry about whether you'll get married in six months or
      eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm worrying about whether I'll ever get married at all,&rdquo; from Oliver,
      rebelliously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough, which is where I'm glowingly sympathetic for you, though you
      may not notice it. But you're one of the few people I know&mdash;officers
      at least&mdash;who came out of the war without stepping all through their
      American home ideas of morality like a clown through a fake glass window.
      And I'm&mdash;Freuded&mdash;if I see how or why you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't myself&mdash;unless you call it pure accident&rdquo; says Oliver,
      frankly. &ldquo;Well, that's it&mdash;women. Don't think I'm in love but the
      other thing pulls pretty strong. And I want to get married all right, but
      what girls I know and like best are in Peter's crowd and most of them own
      their own Rolls Royces&mdash;and I won't be earning even a starvation wage
      for two, inside of three or four years, I suppose. And as you can't get
      away from seeing and talking to women unless you go and live in a cave&mdash;well,
      about once every two weeks or oftener I'd like to chuck every lawbook I
      have out of the window on the head of the nearest cop&mdash;go across
      again and get some sort of a worthless job&mdash;I speak good enough
      French to do it if I wanted&mdash;and go to hell like a gentleman without
      having to worry about it any longer. And I won't do that because I'm
      through with it and the other thing is worth while. So there you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you don't think you're in love&mdash;eh Monsieur Billett?&rdquo; Oliver puts
      irritatingly careful quotation marks around the verb. Ted twists a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all seems so blamed impossible,&rdquo; he says cryptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn't call Elinor Piper <i>that</i> exactly.&rdquo; Oliver grins.
      &ldquo;Even if she is Peter's sister. Old Peter. She's a nice girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>A nice girl?</i>&rdquo; Ted begins rather violently. &ldquo;She's&mdash;why she's&mdash;&rdquo;
       then pauses, seeing the trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh very well&mdash;that's all I wanted to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh don't look so much like a little tin Talleyrand, Ollie! I'm <i>not</i>
      sure&mdash;and that's rather more than I'd even hint to anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, little darling.&rdquo; But Ted has been stung too suddenly, even by
      Oliver's light touch on something which he thought was a complete and
      mortuary secret, to be in a mood for sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, you might as well know. I suppose you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I know is that you seem to have been visiting&mdash;Peter&mdash;a
      good deal this summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it started with Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does so often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord, now I've <i>got</i> to tell you. Not that there's anything&mdash;definite&mdash;to
      tell.&rdquo; He pauses, looking at his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've just been telling you how I feel&mdash;sometimes. And other
      times&mdash;being with Elinor&mdash;she's been so&mdash;kind. But I don't
      know, Ollie, honestly I don't, and that's that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he begins again, &ldquo;the other thing&mdash;Oh, <i>Lord</i>, it's
      so tangled up! But it's just this. It sounds&mdash;funny&mdash;probably&mdash;coming
      from me&mdash;and after France and all that&mdash;but I'm not going to&mdash;pretend
      to myself I'm in love with a girl&mdash;just because I may&mdash;want to
      get married&mdash;the way lots of people do. I can't. And I couldn't with
      a girl like Elinor anyway&mdash;she's too fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is rather fine,&rdquo; says Oliver appreciatively. &ldquo;Selective reticence&mdash;all
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don't you see? And a couple of times&mdash;I've been nearly sure.
      And then something comes and I'm not again&mdash;not the way I want to be.
      And then&mdash;Oh, if I were, it wouldn't be much&mdash;use&mdash;you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, consider our relative positions&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consider your grandmother's cat! She's a girl&mdash;you're a man. She's a
      lady&mdash;you're certainly a gentleman&mdash;though that sounds like Jane
      Austen. And&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she's&mdash;well, she isn't the wealthiest young lady in the country,
      but the Pipers <i>are</i> rich, though they never go and splurge around
      about it. And I'm living on scholarships and borrowed money from the
      family&mdash;and even after I really start working I probably won't make
      enough to live on for two or three years at least. And you can't ask a
      girl like that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ted, this is the twentieth century! I'm not telling you to hang up
      your hat and live on your wife's private income&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;That's
      fortunate,&rdquo; from Ted, rather stubbornly and with a set jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there's no reason on earth&mdash;if you both really loved each other
      and wanted to get married&mdash;why you couldn't let her pay her share for
      the first few years. You know darn well you're going to make money
      sometime&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then. And Elinor's sporting. She isn't the kind that needs six
      butlers to live&mdash;she doesn't live that way now. That's just pride,
      Ted, thinking that&mdash;and a rather bum variety of pride when you come
      down to it. I hate these people who moan around and won't be happy unless
      they can do everything themselves&mdash;they're generally the kind that
      give their wives a charge account at Lucile's and ten dollars a year
      pocket money and go into blue fits whenever poor spouse runs fifty cents
      over her allowance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted pauses, considering. Finally,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Ollie&mdash;I don't think I'm quite that kind of a fool. And almost
      thou convincest me&mdash;and all that. But&mdash;well&mdash;that isn't the
      chief difficulty, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what <i>is</i>?&rdquo; from Oliver, annoyedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted hesitates, speaking slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;after the fact that I'm not sure&mdash;France,&rdquo; he says at
      last, and his mouth shuts after the word as if it never wanted to open
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver spreads both hands out hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you <i>never</i> going to get over that, you ass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't do the things I did,&rdquo; from Ted, rather difficultly. &ldquo;If you
      had&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had I'd have been as sorry as you are, probably, that I'd knocked
      over the apple cart occasionally. But I wouldn't spend the rest of my life
      worrying about it and thinking I wasn't fit to go into decent society
      because of what happened to most of the A.E.F. Why you sound as if you'd
      committed the unpardonable sin. And it's nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;thinking of Elinor&mdash;I'm not too darn sure I didn't,&rdquo; from
      Ted, dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That comes of being born in New England and that's all there is to it.
      Anyhow, it's over now, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly&mdash;it comes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, kick it every time it does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't understand. That and&mdash;people like Elinor&mdash;&rdquo; says
      Ted hopelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't.&rdquo; And this time Ted's face has the look of a burned man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; says Oliver, frankly puzzled. &ldquo;Well, that's it. Oh, it
      doesn't matter. But if there was another war&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, leave us poor people that are trying to write a couple of years
      before you dump us into heroes' graves by the Yang tse Kiang!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another war&mdash;and bang! into the aviation.&rdquo; Ted muses, his face gone
      thin with tensity. &ldquo;It could last as long as it liked for me, providing I
      got through before it did; you'd be living anyhow, living and somebody,
      and somebody who didn't give a plaintive hoot how things broke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighs, and his face smooths back a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lord, I've no real reason to kick, I suppose,&rdquo; he ends. &ldquo;There are
      dozens of 'em like me&mdash;dozens and hundreds and thousands all over the
      shop. We had danger and all the physical pleasures and as much money as we
      wanted and the sense of command&mdash;all through the war. And then they
      come along and say 'it's all off, girls,' and you go back and settle down
      and play you've just come out of College in peace-times and maybe by the
      time you're forty you'll have a wife and an income if another scrap
      doesn't come along. And then when we find it isn't as easy to readjust as
      they think, they yammer around pop-eyed and say 'Oh, what wild young
      people&mdash;what naughty little wasters! They won't settle down and play
      Puss-in-the-corner at all&mdash;and, oh dear, oh dear, how they drink and
      smoke and curse 'n everything!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awful afraid they might be right as to what's the trouble with us,
      though,&rdquo; says Oliver, didactically. &ldquo;We <i>are</i> young, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melgrove!&rdquo; the conductor howls, sleepily. &ldquo;Melgrove! Melgrove!&rdquo;

    <p>
      The Crowe house was both small and inconveniently situated&mdash;it was
      twenty full minutes walk from the station and though a little box of a
      garage had been one of the &ldquo;all modern conveniences&rdquo; so fervidly painted
      in the real estate agent's advertisement, the Crowes had no car. It was
      the last house on Undercliff Road that had any pretense to sparse grass
      and a stubbly hedge&mdash;beyond it were sand-dunes, delusively ornamented
      by the signs of streets that as yet only existed in the brain of the owner
      of the &ldquo;development,&rdquo; and, a quarter of a mile away, the long blue streak
      of the Sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver's key clicked in the lock&mdash;this was fortunately one of the
      times when four-year-old Jane Ellen, who went about after sunset in a
      continual, piteous fear of &ldquo;black men wif masks,&rdquo; had omitted to put the
      chain on the door before being carried mutinously to bed. Oliver switched
      on the hall light and picked up a letter and a folded note from the card
      tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ted, Ollie and Dickie will share that little bijou, the sleeping porch,
      unless Ted prefers the third-story bathtub,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Breakfast at
      convenience for those that can get it themselves&mdash;otherwise at nine.
      And DON'T wake Dickie up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MOTHER.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver passed it to Ted, who read it, grinned, and saluted, nearly
      knocking over the hatrack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For <i>God's</i> sake!&rdquo; said Oliver in a piercing whisper, &ldquo;Jane Ellen
      will think that's Indians!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both listened frantically for a moment, holding their breath. But there
      was no sound from upstairs except an occasional soft rumbling. Oliver had
      often wondered what would happen if the whole sleeping family chanced to
      breathe in and out in unison some unlucky night. He could see the papery
      walls blown apart like scraps of cardboard&mdash;Aunt Elsie falling,
      falling with her bed from her little bird-house under the eaves, giving
      vent to one deaf, terrified &ldquo;Hey&mdash;what's that?&rdquo; as she sank like
      Lucifer cast from Heaven inexorably down into the laundry stove, her
      little tight, white curls standing up on end....
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted had removed his shoes and was making for the stairs with the
      exaggerated caution of a burglar in a film.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Night!&rdquo; called Oliver softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;G' night! Where's my bed&mdash;next the wall? Good&mdash;then I won't
      step on Dickie. And if you fall over me when you come in, I'll bay like a
      bloodhound!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll look out. Be up in a minute myself. Going to write a letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I'd already deduced, Craig Kennedy, my friend. Well, give her my
      love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled like a bad little boy and disappeared round the corner. A stair
      creaked&mdash;they were the kind of stairs that always creaked like old
      women's bones, when you tried to go up them quietly. There was the sound
      of something soft stubbing against something hard and a muffled &ldquo;<i>Sonofa&mdash;</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. Blame near broke my toe on Jane Ellen's doll's porcelain
      head. 'S all right. 'Night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Night.&rdquo; Then in an admonitory sotto-voce, &ldquo;Remember, if you wake Dickie,
      you've got to tell him stories till he goes to sleep again, or he'll wake
      up everybody else!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he wakes, I'll garotte him. 'Night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Night.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver paused for a few minutes, waiting for the crash that would proclaim
      that Ted had stumbled over something and waked Dickie beyond redemption.
      But there was nothing but a soft gurgling of water from the bathroom and
      then, after a while, a slight but definite addition to the distant beehive
      noises of sleep in the house. He smiled, moved cautiously into the dining
      room, sat down at the small sharp-cornered desk where all the family
      correspondence was carried on and from which at least one of the family a
      day received a grievous blow in the side while attempting to get around
      it; lit the shaded light above it and sat down to read his letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all Nancy, that letter, from the address, firm and straight as any
      promise she ever gave, but graceful as the curl of a vine-stem, gracile as
      her hands, with little unsuspected curlicues of humor and fancy making the
      stiff &ldquo;t's&rdquo; bend and twisting the tails of the &ldquo;e's,&rdquo; to the little
      scrunched-up &ldquo;Love, Nancy&rdquo; at the end, as if she had squeezed it there to
      make it look unimportant, knowing perfectly that it was the one really
      important thing in the letter to him. Both would take it so and be
      thankful without greediness or a longing for sentimental &ldquo;x's,&rdquo; with a
      sense that the thing so given must be very rich in little like a jewel,
      and always newly rediscovered with a shiver of pure wonder and thanking,
      or neither could have borne to have it written so small.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Nancy just as some of her clothes were Nancy, soft clear blues and
      first appleblossom pinks, the colors of a hardy garden that has no need
      for the phoenix-colors of the poppy, because it has passed the boy's
      necessity for talking at the top of its voice in scarlet and can hold in
      one shaped fastidious petal, faint-flushed with a single trembling of one
      serene living dye, all the colors the wise mind knows and the soul
      released into its ecstasy has taken for its body invisible, its body of
      delight most spotless, as lightning takes bright body of rapture and agony
      from the light clear pallor that softens a sky to night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver read the letter over twice&mdash;it was with a satisfaction like
      that when body and brain are fed at once, invisibly, by the same lustre of
      force, that he put it away. One part of it, though, left him humanly
      troubled enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Winters, the old incubus, came around and was soppy to mother as
      usual yesterday&mdash;the same old business&mdash;I might be studying in
      Paris, now, instead of teaching drawing to stupid little girls, if I
      hadn't 'formed' what she will call 'that unfortunate attachment.' Not that
      I minded, really, though I was angry enough to bite her when she gave a
      long undertaker's list of Penniless Authors' Brides. But it worries mother&mdash;and
      that worries me&mdash;and I wish she wouldn't. Forgive me, Ollie&mdash;and
      then that Richardson complex of mother's came up again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting hurts, naturally,&mdash;and I'm the person who used to wonder
      about girls making such a fuss about how soon they got married&mdash;but,
      then, Ollie, of course, I never really wanted to get married before myself
      and somehow that seems to make a difference. But that's the way things go&mdash;and
      the only thing I wish is that I was the only person to be hurt. We will,
      sooner or later, and it will be all the better for our not having grabbed
      at once&mdash;at least that's what all the old people with no emotions
      left are always so anxious to tell you. But they talk about it as if
      anybody under thirty-five who wanted to get married was acting like a
      three-year-old stealing jam&mdash;and that's annoying. And anyhow, it
      wouldn't be bad, if I weren't so silly, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting hurts, naturally,&rdquo; and that casual sentence made him chilly
      afraid. For to be in love, though it may force the lover to actions of
      impossible courage does not make him in the least courageous of himself,
      but only drives him by the one large fear of losing this love like a
      soldier pricked from behind by a bayonet over the bodies of smaller fears,
      or like a thief who has stolen treasure, and, hearing the cry at his
      heels, scales a twenty foot wall with the agile gestures of a madman. All
      the old-wives' and young men's club stories of everything from broken
      engagements to the Generic and Proven Unfaithfulness of the Female Sex
      brushed like dirty cobwebs for an instant across his mind. They tightened
      about it like silk threads&mdash;a snaky web&mdash;and for one scared
      instant he had a sense of being smothered in dusty feathers, whispering
      together and saying, &ldquo;When you're a little older and a great deal wiser.
      When you've come to my age and know that all girls are the same. When you
      realize that long engagements seldom mean marriage. When&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put the cobwebs aside with a strain of will, for he was very tired in
      body, and settled himself to write to Nancy. It was not the cobwebs that
      hurt. The only thing that mattered was that she had been hurt on his
      account&mdash;was being hurt now on his account&mdash;would be hurt, and
      still and always on his account, not because he wanted to hurt her but
      because it was not within his power, but Life's, to hurt her in that
      respect or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, felicitous Nancy!&rdquo; the pen began to scratch. &ldquo;Your letter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stupid to be so tired when he was writing to Nancy. Stupid not to find the
      right things to say at once when you wanted to say them so much. He
      dropped the pen an instant, sat back, and tried to evoke Nancy before him
      like a small, clear picture seen in a lens, tried to form with his will
      the lifeless air in front of him till it began to take on some semblance
      and body of her that would be better than the tired remembrances of the
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often, and especially when he had thought about her intensely for a long
      time, the picture would not come at all or come with tantalizing
      incompleteness, apparently because he wanted it to be whole so much&mdash;all
      he could see would be a wraith of Nancy, wooden as a formal photograph,
      with none of her silences or mockeries about her till he felt like a
      painter who has somehow let the devil into his paintbox so that each
      stroke he makes goes a little fatally out of true from the vision in his
      mind till the canvas is only a crazy-quilt of reds and yellows. Now,
      perhaps, though, she might come, even though he was tired. He pressed the
      back of a hand against his eyes. She was coming to him now. He remembered
      one of their walks together&mdash;a walk they had taken some eight months
      ago, when they had been only three days engaged. Up Fifth Avenue;
      Forty-second Street, Forty-third, Forty-fourth, the crosstown glitter of
      lights, the reflected glow of Broadway, spraying the sky with dim
      gold-dust, begins to die a little behind them. Past pompous expensive
      windows full of the things that Oliver and Nancy will buy when Oliver's
      novel has gone into its first fifty thousand, content with the mere touch
      of each other's hands, they are so sure of each other now. Past people,
      dozens of people, getting fewer and fewer as Forty-sixth Street comes,
      Forty-seventh, Forty-eighth, always a little arrogantly because none of
      the automatic figures they pass have ever eaten friendly bread together or
      had fire that can burn over them like clear salt water or the knowledge
      that the only thing worth having in life is the hurt and gladness of that
      fire. Buses pass like big squares of honeycomb on wheels, crowded with
      pale, tired bees&mdash;the stars march slowly from the western slope to
      their light viewless pinnacle in the center of the heavens, walking
      brightly like strong men in silvered armor&mdash;the stars and the buses,
      the buses and the stars, either and both of as little and much account&mdash;it
      would not really surprise either Oliver or Nancy if the next green bus
      that passes should start climbing into the sky like a clumsy bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first intoxication is still upon them&mdash;they have told nobody
      except anyone who ever sees them together&mdash;they walk tactfully and
      never too close, both having a horror of publicly amatory couples, but
      like the king's daughter&mdash;or was it Solomon's Temple?&mdash;they are
      all glorious within. Fifty-fifth, Fifty-sixth, Fifty-seventh&mdash;the
      square in front of the Plaza&mdash;that tall chopped bulky tower lit from
      within like a model in a toyshop window&mdash;motors purring up to its
      door like thin dark cats, motors purring away. The fountain with the
      little statue&mdash;the pool a cool dark stone cracked with the gold of
      the lights upon it, and near the trees of the Park, half-hidden, gold
      Sherman, riding, riding, Victory striding ahead of him with a golden palm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ahead of them too goes Victory, over fear, over doubt, over littleness,
      her gold shoes ring like the noise of a sparkling sword, her steps are
      swift. They stand for an instant, hands locked, looking back at the long
      roller-coaster swoop of the Avenue, listening to the roll of tired wheels,
      the faint horns, the loud horns. They know each other now&mdash;their
      hands grip tighter&mdash;in the wandering instant the whole background of
      streets and tall buildings passes like breath from a mirror&mdash;for the
      instant without breath or clamor, they exist together, one being, and the
      being has neither flesh to use the senses too clumsily, nor human thoughts
      to rust at the will, but lives with the strength of a thunder and the
      heedlessness of a wave in a wide and bright eternity of the unspoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; says Nancy, when the moment passes, lifting a shoe with
      the concern of a kitten that has just discovered a thorn in its paw, &ldquo;New
      York pavements are certainly <i>hard</i> on loving feet.&rdquo;

      VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      So the picture came. And other pictures like it. And since the living that
      had made them was past for a little they were both fainter and in a
      measure brighter with more elfin colors than even that living had been
      which had made them glow at first. White memory had taken them into her
      long house of silence where everything is cool with the silver of Spring
      rain on leaves, she had washed from them the human pettiness, the human
      separateness, the human insufficiency to express the best that must come
      in any mortal relationship that lasts longer than the hour. They were not
      better in memory than they had been when lived, for the best remembrance
      makes only brilliant ghosts, but they were in their dim measure nearer the
      soul's perfection, for the tricks of the sounding board of the mind and
      the feckless instrument of the body had been put away. &ldquo;We've had
      infinites already&mdash;infinites,&rdquo; thought Oliver, and didn't care about
      the ludicrous ineptness of the words. He smiled, turning back to the
      unwritten letter. If they hadn't had infinites already&mdash;he supposed
      they wouldn't want more so badly right now. He smiled, but this time
      without humor. It had all seemed so easy at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy had been in Paris at fourteen before &ldquo;business reverses&rdquo; of the kind
      that mild, capable-looking men like Mr. Ellicott seem to attract, as a
      gingerbread man draws wasps, when they are about fifty, had reduced him to
      a position as chief bookkeeper and taken Nancy out of her first year in
      Farmington. Oliver had spent nine months on a graduate scholarship in
      Paris and Provence in 1919. Both had friends there and argued long playful
      hours planning just what sort of a magnificently cheap apartment on the <i>Rive
      Gauche</i> they would have when they went back.
    </p>
    <p>
      For they were going back&mdash;they had been brilliantly sure of it&mdash;Oliver
      had only to finish his novel that was so much better already than any
      novel Nancy had ever read&mdash;sell a number of copies of it that seemed
      absurdly small in proportion to the population of America&mdash;and then
      they could live where they pleased and Oliver could compose Great Works
      and Nancy get ahead with her very real and delicate talent for etching
      instead of having to do fashion-drawings of slinky simperers in Lucile
      dresses or appetite-arousing paintings of great cans of tomato soup. But
      that had been eight months ago. Vanamee and Company's&mdash;the neat
      vice-president talking to Oliver&mdash;&ldquo;a young hustler has every chance
      in the world of getting ahead here, Mr. Crowe. You speak French? Well, we
      have been thinking for some time of establishing branch-offices in
      Europe.&rdquo; The chance of a stop-gap job in St. Louis for Nancy, where she
      could be with her family for a while&mdash;she really ought to be with
      them a couple of months at least, if she and Oliver were to be married so
      soon. The hopeful parting in the Grand Central&mdash;&ldquo;But, Nancy, you're
      sure you wouldn't mind going across second-class?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Ollie, dear, how silly! Why, what would it matter?&rdquo; &ldquo;All right, then,
      and remember, I'll wire <i>just</i> as soon as things really start to
      break&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then for eight months, nothing at all but letters and letters, except
      two times, once in New York, once in St. Louis, when both had spent
      painful savings because they simply had to see each other again, since
      even the best letters were only doll-house food you could look at and wish
      you could eat&mdash;and both had tried so hard to make each disappearing
      minute perfect before they had to catch trains again that the effort left
      them tired as jugglers who have been balancing too many plates and edgy at
      each other for no cause in the world except the unfairness that they could
      only have each other now for so short a time. And the people, the vast
      unescapable horde of the dull-but-nice or the merely dull who saw in their
      meetings nothing either particularly spectacular or pitiful or worth
      applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      And always after the parting, a little crippled doubt tapping its crutches
      along the alleys of either mind. &ldquo;Do I <i>really?</i> Because if I do, how
      can I be so tired sometimes with her, with him? And why can't I say more
      and do more and be more when he, when she? And everybody says. And they're
      older than we are&mdash;mightn't it be true? And&mdash;&rdquo; And then,
      remorsefully, the next day, all doubt burnt out by the clear hurt of
      absence. &ldquo;Oh how could I! When it is real&mdash;when it is like that&mdash;when
      it is the only thing worth while in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But absence and meetings of this sort told on them inescapably, and both
      being, unfortunately, of a rather high-strung intelligence and youth,
      recognized it, no matter how much consciousness might deny it, and
      wondered sometimes, rather pitiably, why they couldn't be always at one
      temperature, like lovers in poetry, and why either should ever worry or
      hurt the other when they loved. Any middle-aged person could and did tell
      them that they were now really learning something about love&mdash;omitting
      the small fact that Pain, though he comes with the highest literary
      recommendations is really not the wisest teacher of all in such matters&mdash;all
      of which helped the constant nervous and psychological strain on both as
      little as a Latin exorcism would help a fever. For the very reason that
      they wished to be true in their love, they said things in their letters
      that a spoken word or a gesture would have explained in an instant but
      that no printed alphabet could; and so they often hurt each other while
      meaning and trying to help all they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not quite as easy as it had seemed at first&mdash;oh, not on your life
      not, thought Oliver, rousing out of a gloomy muse. And then there was the
      writing he wanted to do&mdash;and Nancy's etching&mdash;&ldquo;our damn careers&rdquo;
       they had called them&mdash;but those <i>were</i> the things they did best&mdash;and
      neither had had even tolerable working conditions recently&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, sufficient to the day was the evil thereof&mdash;that was one of
      those safe Bible-texts you seemed to find more and more use for the older
      you grew. Bible-texts. It was lucky tomorrow was Sunday when slaves of the
      alarm-clock had peace. Oliver straightened his shoulders unconsciously and
      turned back to the blank paper. He did love Nancy. He did love Nancy. That
      was all that counted.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Oh, felicitous Nancy!
  Your letter was&mdash;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      The water was a broken glass of blue, sunstruck waves&mdash;there were few
      swimmers in it where the two friends went in next morning, for the beach
      proper with its bath-houses and float was nearly a quarter of a mile down.
      Oliver could see Margaret's red cap bobbing twenty yards out as he tried
      the water cautiously with curling toes, and, much farther out, a blue cap
      and the flash of an arm going suddenly under. Mrs. Severance, the friend
      Louise had brought out for the week-end, he supposed; she swam remarkably
      for a woman. He swam well enough himself and couldn't give her two yards
      in the hundred. Ted stood beside him, both tingling a little at the fresh
      of the salt air. &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; and they plunged.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mock race followed for twenty yards&mdash;then Oliver curved off to duck
      Margaret, already screaming and paddling at his approach, while Ted kept
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swam face deep, catching short breaths under the crook of his arm,
      burying himself in the live blue running sparkle, every muscle stretched
      as if he were trying to rub all the staleness that can come to the mind
      and the restless pricklings that will always worry the body clean from
      him, like a snake's cast skin, against the wet rough hands of the water.
      There&mdash;it was working&mdash;the flesh was compact and separate no
      longer&mdash;he felt it dissolve into the salt push of spray&mdash;become
      one with that long blue body of wave that stretched fluently radiant for
      miles and miles till it too was no more identity but only sea, receiving
      the sun, without thought, without limbs, without pain. He sprinted with
      the last breath he had in him to annihilation in that light lustrous
      firmament. Then his flung-out hand struck something firm and smooth. With
      the momentary twinge of a jarred toe, he stopped in the middle of a
      stroke, grabbed at the firm thing unthinkingly, felt it slip away from
      him, trod water and came up gasping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm <i>horribly</i> sorry!&rdquo; Gurgle and choke at water gone the wrong
      way. &ldquo;Honestly&mdash;what a dumb-bell trick! but I didn't see you at <i>all</i>
      and with the whole Sound to swim in I thought I was safe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed the water out of his eyes. A woman in a blue cap. Pretty, too&mdash;not
      one of the pretty kind that look like drenched paper-dolls in swimming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't apologize&mdash;it's all my fault, really. I should have heard you
      coming, I suppose, but I was floating and my ears were under water&mdash;and
      this cap! You did scare me a little, though; I didn't know there was
      anyone else in miles&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled frankly. Ted got another look at her and decided that pretty
      was hardly right. Beautiful, perhaps, but you couldn't tell with her hair
      that way under her cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're Mr. Billett, aren't you? Louise said last night that her brother
      was bringing a friend over Sunday. She also said that she'd introduce us&mdash;but
      we seem to have done that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather. Introduction by drowning. The latest cleverness in Newport
      circles&mdash;see 'Mode.' And you're Mrs. Severance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Nice water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A third look&mdash;a fairly long one&mdash;left Ted still puzzled. Age&mdash;thirty?
      thirty-five? Swims perfectly. On &ldquo;Mode.&rdquo; Wide eyes, sea-blue,
      sea-changing. An odd nose that succeeded in being beautiful in spite of
      itself. A rather full small mouth, not loose with sense nor rigid with
      things controlled, but a mouth that would suck like a bee at the last and
      tiniest drop of any physical sweet which the chin and the eyes had once
      decided to want. The eyes measure, the mouth asks, the cleft chin finds
      the way. A face neither content, nor easily to be contented&mdash;in
      repose it is neither happy nor unhappy but only matured. Louise's friend&mdash;that
      was funny&mdash;Louise had such an ideal simplicity of mind. Well&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you float&mdash;after a while you don't know quite where you're
      floating,&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance's voice detachedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted made no answer but turned over, spreading out his arms. For a few
      moments they lay like corpses on the blue swelling round of the water
      looking straight through infinite distance into the thin faint vapor of
      the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might be clouds, almost, mightn't we?&rdquo; with a slow following note of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted looked deeper into the sky, half-closing his eyelids. It seemed to
      take his body from him completely, to leave him nothing but a naked
      soothed consciousness, rising and falling, a petal on a swinging bough, in
      the heart of blue quietude like the quiet of an open place in a forest
      empty with evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clouds,&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance's voice, turning the word to a sound
      breathed lightly through the curled and husky gold of a forest-horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the midst of his sea-drowsiness a queer thought came to Ted. This
      had happened before, in sleep perhaps, in a book he had read&mdash;Oliver's
      novel, possibly, he thought and smiled. Lying alone on a roof of blue
      water, and yet not lying alone, for there was that slow warm voice that
      talked from time to time and came into the mind on tiptoe like the
      creeping of soft-shoed, hasteless, fire. You stretched your hands to the
      fire and let it warm you and soon your whole body was warm and pleased and
      alive. That was when you were alive past measure, when all of you had been
      made warm as a cat fed after being hungry, and the cat arose from its
      warmth and went walking on velvet paws, stretching sleek legs, sleek body,
      slowly and exquisitely under the firelight, heavy with warmth, but ready
      at the instant signal of the small burning thing in its mind to turn like
      a black butterfly and dance a slow seeking dance with the shadows of the
      fire that flickered like leaves in light wind, desirable, impalpable and
      wavering, never to be quite torn down from the wall and eaten and so
      possessed. But there was an odd thirsty satisfaction in trying to tear the
      shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fantastic. He had not been so fantastic for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tomorrow there's 'Mode.' And fashion-plates. <i>And</i> Greenwich
      Villagers,&rdquo; said the voice of Mrs. Severance. He made some reply
      impatiently, disliking the sound of his own voice&mdash;hers fitted with
      the dream. When had he been this before?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Morte d'Arthur&mdash;the two with a sword between.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sank deeper, deeper, into the glow of that imagined firelight&mdash;the
      flame was cooler than water to walk through&mdash;that time he had almost
      taken a turning shadow into his hand. The sword between&mdash;only here
      there was no sword. If he reached out his hand he knew just how the hand
      that he touched would feel, cool and firm, like that flame. Cool and
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There must have been something, somewhere, to make him remember....
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later Oliver had splashed up to them, shouting &ldquo;A rescue! A
      rescue! Guests Drown While Host Looks On Smilingly! What's the matter,
      Ted, you look as if you wanted to turn into a submarine? Got cramp?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crowe relaxed a little for the first tired minute of her day. Sunday
      dinner was nearly over, and though, in one way, the best meal in the week
      for her because all her children were sure to be at home, it was apt to be
      pure purgatory on a hot day, with Sheba dawdling and grumbling and
      Rosalind spilling pea-soup on her Sunday dress, and Aunt Elsie's deafness
      increased by the weather to the point of mild imbecility.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been a little afraid today, especially with two guests and the
      grandchildren rampant after church, and the extra leaf in the table that
      squeezed Colonel Crowe almost into the sideboard and herself nearly out of
      the window and made the serving of a meal a series of passings of over-hot
      plates from hand to hand, exposed to the piracies of Jane Ellen. But it
      had gone off better than she could have hoped. Colonel Crowe had not
      absent-mindedly begun to serve vegetables with a teaspoon, Aunt Elsie had
      not dissolved in tears and tottered away from the table at some imagined
      rudeness of Dickie's, and Jane Ellen had not once had a chance to take off
      her drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ice tea!&rdquo; said the avid voice of Jane Ellen in her ear. &ldquo;Ice tea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crowe filled the glass and submitted a request for &ldquo;please&rdquo;
       mechanically. She wondered, rather idly, if she would spend her time in
      purgatory serving millions of Jane Ellens with iced tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; That was Colonel Crowe. &ldquo;But you should have known us in the days
      of our greatness, Mrs. Severance. When I was king of Estancia&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather have you like this, Colonel Crowe, really. I've always wanted
      big families and never had one to live in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heard from Nancy recently, Oliver?&rdquo; from Margaret, slightly satiric.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes, Margie, now and then. Not as often as you've heard from Stu
      Winthrop probably but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Motha, can I have some suga on my booberrish? Motha, can I have some suga
      on my booberrish? Motha&mdash;<i>peesh!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hush a minute, Rosalind dear. I don't know, Oliver. I'll speak to Mr.
      Field about it if you like. I should think they'd take little sketches
      like a couple of those Nancy showed you&mdash;though they aren't quite
      smart-alecky enough for 'Mode'&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Grandfather, Grandfather! How old
      would you be if you were as old as Methusaleh? Are you older than he is?
      <i>Grandfather!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Entrance and exit of a worried Sheba with the empty dish of blueberries,
      marred only by Jane Ellen's sudden cries of &ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crowe tried to think a little ahead. Tomorrow. Ice. Butter. Laundry.
      Oliver's breakfast early again. Louise&mdash;poor Louise&mdash;two years
      and a half since Clifford Lychgate died. How curious life was; how curious
      and careless and inconsecutive. The thought of how much she hoped Oliver's
      novel would succeed and the question as to whether the Thebes grocer who
      delivered by motor-truck would be cheaper than the similar Melgrove bandit
      in the long run mixed uneasily in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosalind had seemed droopy that morning&mdash;more green crab-apples
      probably. Aunt Elsie's gout. Oliver's marriage&mdash;she had been so
      relieved about Nancy ever since she had met her, though it had been hard
      to reconcile domestic virtues with Nancy's bobbed hair. She would make
      Oliver happy, though, and that was the main thing. She was really sweet&mdash;a
      sweet girl. Long engagements. Too bad, too bad. Something <i>must</i> be
      done about the stair carpet, the children were tearing it to pieces. &ldquo;Ice
      tea! Ice tea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Jane Ellen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peesh yash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Now be a good little girl and run out and play quietly, not right in
      the middle of the broiling sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so Lizzie said, 'Very well, but if I do take that medicine my death
      will be wholly on your responsibility!'&rdquo; with a sense of climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I really would like to, Mrs. Severance, if you can ever spare the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted and Louise's friend seemed to be getting along very well. That was
      nice&mdash;so often Oliver's friends and Louise's didn't. It seemed odd
      that Mrs. Severance should be working on &ldquo;Mode&rdquo;&mdash;surely a girl of her
      obvious looks and intelligence left with no children to support&mdash;some
      nice man&mdash;A lady, too, by her voice, though there was a trifle of
      something&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She only hoped Mrs. Severance didn't think them all too crowded and noisy.
      It was a little hard on the three children to have such an&mdash;intimate&mdash;home
      when they brought friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we'd better have coffee out on the porch, don't you?&rdquo; That meant
      argument with Sheba later but an hour's cool and talk without having to
      shout across the dear little children was worth the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody got up, Ted being rather gallant to Mrs. Severance. Oliver
      looked worried today, worried and tired. She hoped it wasn't about Nancy
      and the engagement. What a miserable thing money was to make so much
      difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Severance&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Billett&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Louise's friend was certainly attractive. That wonderful red-gold hair&mdash;&ldquo;setter
      color&rdquo; her sister had always called it of her own. She must write her
      sister. Mrs. Severance&mdash;an odd name. She rather wished, though, that
      her face wouldn't turn faintly hard like that sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Dickie. No chocolate unless your mother says you can have it. No,
      Rosalind, if mother says not, you <i>certainly</i> cannot go over and play
      at the Rogers',&mdash;they have a paralytic grandmother who is very
      nervous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, that was over. And now, for a few brief instants there would be
      quiet and a chance to relax and really see something of Oliver. Mrs. Crowe
      started moving slowly towards the door. Ted and Mrs. Severance blocked the
      way, talking rather intimately, she thought, for people who had only known
      each other a few hours; but then that was the modern way. Then Ted saw her
      and seemed to wake up with a jump from whatever mild dream possessed him,
      and Mrs. Severance turned toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so <i>comfortable</i> being out here, always,&rdquo; she said very
      naturally and kindly, but Mrs. Crowe did not reply at once to the pretty
      speech. Instead she flushed deeply and bent over something small and white
      on the chair with the dictionary in it that had been next to hers. Jane
      Ellen had finally succeeded in taking off her drawers.

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
      Ted and Oliver were down at the beach at Southampton two Sundays later&mdash;week-end
      guests of Peter Piper&mdash;the three had been classmates at Yale and the
      friendship had not lapsed like so many because Peter happened to be rich
      and Ted and Oliver poor. And then there was always Elinor, Peter's sister&mdash;Ted
      seemed, to Oliver's amused vision, at least, to be looking at Elinor with
      the hungry eyes of a man seeing a delicate, longed-for dream made flesh
      just at present instead of a girl he had known since she first put up her
      hair. How nice that would be if it happened, thought Oliver,
      match-makingly&mdash;how very nice indeed! Best thing in the world for Ted&mdash;and
      Elinor too&mdash;if Ted would only get away from his curiously Puritan
      idea that a few minor lapses from New England morality in France
      constituted the unpardonable sin, at least as far as marrying a nice girl
      was concerned. He stretched back lazily, digging elbows into the warm
      sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had really been too hot for anything more vigorous than &ldquo;just
      lying around in the sun like those funny kinds of lizards,&rdquo; as Peter put
      it, and besides, he and Oliver had an offensive-defensive alliance of The
      Country's Tiredest Young Business Men and insisted that their only
      function in life was to be gently and graciously amused. And certainly the
      spectacle about them was one to provide amusement in the extreme for even
      the most mildly satiric mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the beach's most crowded hour and the short strip of sand in front
      of the most fashionable and uncomfortable place to bathe on Long Island
      was gay as a patch of exhibition sweet-peas with every shade of vivid or
      delicate color. It was a triumph of women&mdash;the whole glittering,
      moving bouquet of stripes and patterns and tints that wandered slowly from
      one striped parasol-mushroom to the next&mdash;the men, in their bathing
      suits or white flannels seemed as unimportant if necessary furniture as
      slaves in an Eastern court. The women dominated, from the jingle of the
      bags in the hands of the dowagers and the faint, protesting creak of their
      corsets as they picked their way as delicately as fat, gorgeous macaws
      across the sand, to the sound of their daughters' voices, musical as a
      pigeon-loft, as they chattered catchwords at each other and their
      partners, or occasionally, very occasionally, dipped in for a three-minute
      swim. Moreover, and supremely, it was a triumph of ritual, and such ritual
      as reminded Oliver a little of the curious, unanimous and apparently
      meaningless movements of a colony of penguins, for the entire assemblage
      had arrived around, twelve o'clock and by a quarter past one not one of
      them would be left. That was law as unwritten and unbreakable as that law
      which governs the migratory habits of wild geese. And within that little
      more than an hour possibly one-third of them would go as far as wetting
      their hands in the water&mdash;all the rest had come for the single reason
      of seeing and being seen. It was all extremely American and, on the whole,
      rather superb, Oliver thought as he and Peter moved over nearer to the
      parasol that sheltered Elinor and Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it was Egypt,&rdquo; said Peter languidly. &ldquo;Any more peppermints left,
      El? No&mdash;well, Ted never could restrain himself when it came to food.
      I wish it was Egypt,&rdquo; he repeated, making Elinor's left foot a pillow for
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's hot enough,&rdquo; from Oliver, dozingly. &ldquo;Ah&mdash;oo&mdash;it's <i>hot</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, but just think,&rdquo; Peter chuckled. &ldquo;Clothes,&rdquo; he explained
      cryptically, &ldquo;Mrs. Willamette in a Cleopatra nightie&mdash;what sport! And
      besides, I should make a magnificent Egyptian. Magnificent.&rdquo; He yawned
      immensely. &ldquo;In the first place, of course, I should paint myself a
      brilliant orange&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Egyptians. An odd wonder rose in Ted&mdash;a wonder as to whether one
      of those stripped and hook-nosed slaves of the bondage before Moses had
      ever happened to stand up for a moment to wipe the sweat out of his eyes
      before he bent again to his task of making bricks without straw and seen a
      princess of the Egyptians carried along past the quarries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us a story, El,&rdquo; from Oliver in the voice of one who is
      sleep-walking. &ldquo;A nice quiet story&mdash;the Three Bears or Giant the Jack
      Killer&mdash;oh heaven, I <i>must</i> be asleep&mdash;but you know,
      anything like that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really want a story?&rdquo; Elinor's voice was reticently mocking. &ldquo;A story
      for good little boys?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>yes!</i>&rdquo; from Peter, his clasped hands stretched toward her in an
      attitude of absurd supplication. &ldquo;All in nice little words of one syllable
      or we won't understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, once there were three little girls named Elsie, Lacie and Tillie
      and they lived in the bottom of a well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      [ILLUSTRATION: &ldquo;WELL, ONCE THERE WERE THREE LITTLE GIRLS&rdquo;] &ldquo;What <i>kind</i>
      of a well?&rdquo; Oliver had caught the cue at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A treacle well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      She went on with the Dormouse's Tale, but Ted, for once, hardly heard her&mdash;his
      mind was too busy with its odd, Egyptological dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess who looked like Elinor. Her slaves would come first&mdash;a
      fat bawling eunuch, all one black glisten like new patent-leather,
      striking with a silver rod to clear dogs and crocodiles and Israelites out
      of the way. Then the litter&mdash;and a flash between curtains blown aside
      for an instant&mdash;and Hook Nose gazing and gazing&mdash;all the fine
      fighting curses of David on the infidel, that he had muttered sourly under
      breath all day, blowing away from him like sand from the face of a sphinx.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomp sounding in brass and cries all around the litter like the boasting
      color of a trumpet&mdash;but in the litter not pomp but fineness passing.
      Fineness of youth untouched, from the clear contrast of white skin and
      crow-black hair to the hands that had the little stirrings of moon-moths
      against the green robe. Fineness of mind that will not admit the
      unescapable minor dirts of living, however much it may see them, a mind
      temperate with reticence and gentleness, seeing not life itself but its
      own delighted dream of it, a heart that had had few shocks as yet, and
      never the ones that the heart must be mailed or masked to withstand. The
      thing that passed had been continually sheltered, exquisitely guarded from
      the stronger airs of life as priests might guard a lotus, and yet it was
      neither tenderly unhealthy nor sumptuously weak. A lotus&mdash;that was it&mdash;and
      Hook Nose stood looking at the lotus&mdash;and because it was innocent he
      filled his eyes with it. And then it passed and its music went out of the
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ted</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? What? Oh, yeah&mdash;sorry, Elinor, I wasn't paying proper
      attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you were asleep, you big cheese!&rdquo; from Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't&mdash;just thinking,&rdquo; and seeing that this only brought raucous
      mirth from both Peter and Oliver, &ldquo;Oh, shut up, you apes! Were you asking
      me something, El?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was rather a change to come back from Elinor in scarab robes being
      carried along in a litter to Elinor sitting beside him in a bathing suit.
      But hardly an unpleasant change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've forgotten how it goes on&mdash;the Dormouse&mdash;after 'Well in.'
      Do you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nope. Look it up when we get back. And anyhow&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Game called for to-day. The Lirrups have started looking important&mdash;that
      means it's about ten minutes of, they always leave on the dot. Well&mdash;&rdquo;
       and Peter rose, scattering sand. &ldquo;We must obey our social calendar, my
      prominent young friends&mdash;just think how awful it would be if we were
      the last to go. Race you half-way to the float and back, Ted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're on,&rdquo; and the next few minutes were splashingly athletic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going back to the bath-house, though, Ted laughed at himself rather
      whimsically. That extraordinary day-dream of the slave and the Elinor
      Princess! It helped sometimes, to make pictures of the very impossible&mdash;even
      of things as impossible as that. If Elinor had only been older before the
      war came along and changed so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw another little mental photograph, the kind of photograph, he mused,
      that sleekly shabby Frenchmen slip from under views of the Vendome Column
      and Napoleon's Tomb when they are trying to sell tourists picture
      post-cards outside the Café de la Paix. Judged by American standards the
      work would be called rather frank. It was all interior&mdash;the interior
      of a room in a Montmartre hotel&mdash;and there were two people in it to
      help out the composition&mdash;and the face of one seemed somehow to be
      rather deathly familiar&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That, and Elinor. Why, Hook Nose could &ldquo;reform&rdquo; all the rest of his life
      in accordance with the highest dictionary standards&mdash;and still he
      wouldn't be fit to look at his princess, even from inside a cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, if you happened to be of a certain analytic temperament you could
      see what was happening to yourself all the while quite plainly&mdash;oh,
      much too plainly!&mdash;and yet that seemed to make very little difference
      in its going on happening. There was Mrs. Severance, for instance. He had
      been seeing quite a good deal of Mrs. Severance lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ted!&rdquo; from Peter next door. &ldquo;Snap it up, old keed, or we'll all of us
      be late for lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had just sat down to lunch and Peter was complaining that the whipped
      cream on the soup made him feel as if he were eating cotton-batting, when
      a servant materialized noiselessly beside Oliver's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telephone for you, Mr. Crowe. Western Union calling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver jumped up with suspicious alacrity. &ldquo;Oh, love, love, love!&rdquo; crooned
      Peter. &ldquo;Oh, love, love, love!&rdquo; Oliver flushed. &ldquo;Don't swipe all my butter,
      you simple cynic!&rdquo; He knew what it was, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Oliver Crowe talking. Will you give me the telegram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy and Oliver, finding Sunday mails of a dilatory unsatisfactoriness,
      had made a compact to use the wire on that day instead. And even now
      Oliver never listened to the mechanical buzz of Central's voice in his ear
      without a little pulse of the heart. It seemed to bring Nancy nearer than
      letters could, somehow. Nancy had an imperial contempt for boiling down
      attractive sentences to the necessary ten or twenty words. This time,
      though, the telegram was short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Oliver Crowe, care Peter Piper, Southampton,&rdquo; clicked Central
      dispassionately. &ldquo;I hate St. Louis. I would give anything in the world if
      we could only see each other for twenty-four hours. Love. Signed, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Oliver, after hanging up the receiver, went back to the dining-room
      with worry barking and running around his mind like a spoiled puppy,
      wondering savagely why so many rocking-chair people took a <i>crêpey</i>
      pleasure in saying it was good for young people in love to have to wait.

    <h2>
      XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tea for two at the Gondolier, that newest and quotation-marked &ldquo;Quaintest&rdquo;
       of Village tea rooms. The chief points in the Gondolier's &ldquo;quaintness&rdquo;
       seem to be that it is chopped up into as many little partitions as a
      roulette wheel and that all food has to be carried up from a cellar that
      imparts even to orange marmalade a faint persuasive odor of somebody
      else's wash. Still, during the last eight months, the Gondolier has been a
      radical bookstore devoted to bloody red pamphlets, a batik shop full of
      strange limp garments ornamented with decorative squiggles, and a
      Roumanian Restaurant called &ldquo;The Brodska&rdquo; whose menu seemed to consist
      almost entirely of old fish and maraschino cherries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wispy little woman from Des Moines who conducts the Gondolier at
      present in a series of timid continual flutters at actually leading the
      life of the Bohemian untamed, and who gives all the young hungry-looking
      men extra slices of toast because any one of them might be Vachel Lindsay
      in disguise, will fail in another six weeks and then the Gondolier may
      turn into anything from a Free Verse Tavern to a Meeting Hall for the
      Friends of Slovak Freedom. But at present, the tea is much too good for
      the price in spite of its inescapable laundry tang, and there is a flat
      green bowl full of Japanese iris bulbs in the window&mdash;the second of
      which pleases Mrs. Severance and the first Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides like most establishments on the verge of bankruptcy, it is such a
      quiet place to talk&mdash;the only other two people in it are a boy with
      startled hair and an orange smock and a cigaretty girl called Tommy, and
      she is far too busy telling him that that dream about wearing a necklace
      of flying-fish shows a dangerous inferiority complex even to comment
      caustically on strangers from uptown who <i>will</i> intrude on the dear
      Village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny stuff&mdash;dreams,&rdquo; says Ted uneasily, catching at overheard
      phrases for a conversational jumping-off place. His mind, always a little
      on edge now with work and bad feeding, has been too busy since they came
      in comparing Rose Severance with Elinor Piper, and wondering why, when one
      is so like a golden-skinned August pear and the other a branch of winter
      blackberries against snow just fallen, it is not as good but somehow
      warmer to think of the first against your touch than the second, to leave
      him wholly at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;funny stuff,&rdquo; Mrs. Severance's voice is musically quiet. &ldquo;And
      then you tell them to people who pretend to know all about what they mean&mdash;and
      then&mdash;&rdquo; She shrugs shoulders at the Freudian two across the
      shoulder-high partition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't believe in all this psycho-analysis tosh, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitates. &ldquo;A little, yes. Like the old woman and ghosts. I may not
      believe in it but I'm afraid of it, rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gives him a steady look&mdash;her eyes go deep. It is not so much the
      intensity of the look as its haltingness that makes warmth go over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we tell our dreams&mdash;the favorite ones, I mean? Play fair if we
      do, remember,&rdquo; she adds slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you're really afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? But it's just because I am afraid that I really should, you know. Like
      going into a dark room when you don't want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they can't be as scary as <i>that</i>, surely.&rdquo; Ted's voice is a
      little false. Both are watching each other intently now&mdash;he with a
      puzzled sense of lazy enveloping firelight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, shall I begin? After all this <i>is</i> tea in the Village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very much interested indeed, Mrs. Severance,&rdquo; says Ted rather
      gravely. &ldquo;Check!&rdquo; &ldquo;How official you sound&mdash;almost as if you had a lot
      of those funny little machines all the modern doctors use and were going
      to mail me off to your pet sanatorium at once because you'd asked me what
      green reminded me of and I said 'cheese' instead of 'trees.' And anyhow, I
      never have any startling dreams&mdash;only silly ones&mdash;much too silly
      to tell&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please go on.&rdquo; Ted's voice has really become quite clinical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh very well. They don't count when you only have them once&mdash;just
      when they keep coming back and back to you&mdash;isn't that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Severance's eyes waver a little&mdash;her mouth seeking for the
      proper kind of dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not much but it comes quite regularly&mdash;the most punctual,
      old-fashioned-servant sort of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't begin with sleep, you know&mdash;it begins with waking. At
      least it's just as if I were in my own bed in my own apartment and then
      gradually I started to wake. You know how you can feel that somebody else
      is in the room though you can't see them&mdash;that's the feeling. And, of
      course being a normal American business woman, my first idea is&mdash;burglars.
      And I'm very cowardly for a minute. Then the cowardice passes and I decide
      to get up and see what it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> somebody else&mdash;or something&mdash;but nobody I think
      that I ever really knew. And at first I don't want to walk toward it&mdash;and
      then I do because it keeps pulling me in spite of myself. So I go to it&mdash;hands
      out so I won't knock over things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then I touch it&mdash;or him&mdash;or her&mdash;and I'm suddenly
      very, very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Dr. Billett, what would you say of my case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted's eyes are glowing&mdash;in the middle of her description his heart
      has begun to knock to a hidden pulse, insistent and soft as the drum of
      gloved fingers on velvet. He picks words carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say&mdash;Mrs. Severance&mdash;that there was something you
      needed and wanted and didn't have at present. And that you would probably
      have it&mdash;in the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughs a little. &ldquo;Rather cryptic, isn't that, doctor? And you'd
      prescribe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prescribe? 'It's an awkward matter to play with souls.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And trouble enough to save your own,'&rdquo; she completes the quotation.
      &ldquo;Yes, that's true enough&mdash;though I'm sorry you can't even tell me to
      use this twice a day in half a glass of water and that other directly
      after each meal. I think I'll have to be a little more definite when it
      comes to your turn&mdash;if it does come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh it will.&rdquo; But instead of beginning, he raises his eyes to her again.
      This time there is a heaviness like sleep on both, a heaviness that draws
      both together inaudibly and down, and down, as if they were sinking
      through piled thickness on thickness of warm, sweet-scented grass. Odd
      faces come into both minds and vanish as if flickered off a film&mdash;to
      Rose Severance, a man narrow and flat as if he were cut out of thin grey
      paper, talking, talking in a voice as dry and rattling as a flapping
      windowblind of their &ldquo;vacation&rdquo; together and a house with a little garden
      where she can sew and he can putter around,&mdash;to Ted, Elinor Piper,
      the profile pure as if it were painted on water, passing like water
      flowing from the earth in springs, in its haughty temperance, its retired
      beauty, its murmurous quiet&mdash;other faces, some trembling as if
      touched with light flames, some calm, some merely grotesque with longing
      or too much pleasure&mdash;all these pass. A great nearness, fiercer and
      more slumbrous than any nearness of body takes their place. It wraps the
      two closer and closer, a spider spinning a soft web out of petals, folding
      the two with swathes and swathes of its heavy, fragrant silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;mine&mdash;isn't anything,&rdquo; says Ted rather unsteadily, after
      the moment. &ldquo;Only looking at firelight and wanting to take the coals in my
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rose's voice is firmer than his but her mouth is still moved with content
      at the thing it has desired being brought nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really can't prescribe on as little evidence as that,&rdquo; she says with
      music come back to her voice in the strength of a running wave. &ldquo;I can
      only repeat what you told me. That there was something you needed&mdash;and
      wanted&rdquo;&mdash;she is mocking now&mdash;&ldquo;and didn't have at present. And
      that you would probably&mdash;what was it?&mdash;oh yes&mdash;have it, in
      the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wispy little woman has crept up to Ted's elbow with an illegible bill.
      Rose has spoken slowly to give her time to get there&mdash;it is always so
      much better to choose your own most effective background for really
      affecting scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I really must be getting back,&rdquo; she cuts in briskly, her fingers
      playing with a hat that certainly needs no rearrangement, when Ted, after
      absent-mindedly paying the bill, is starting to speak in the voice of one
      still sleep-walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it <i>was</i> delightful, Mr. Billett&mdash;I love talking about
      myself and you were really very sweet to listen so nicely.&rdquo; She has
      definitely risen. Ted must, too. &ldquo;We must do it again some time soon&mdash;I'm
      going to see if there aren't any of those books with long German names
      drifting around 'Mode' somewhere so that I'll be able to simply stun you
      with my erudition the next time we talk over dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They are at the door now, she guiding him toward it as imperceptibly and
      skillfully as if she controlled him by wireless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it isn't fair of me to let you give all the parties&mdash;it simply
      isn't. Couldn't you come up to dinner in my little apartment sometime&mdash;it
      really isn't unconventional, especially for anyone who's once seen my
      pattern of an English maid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sunlight and Minetta Lane again&mdash;and whatever Ted may want to say out
      of his walking trance&mdash;this is certainly no place where any of it can
      be said.

      Oliver Crowe, at his desk in the copy-department of Vanamee and Co.'s, has
      been spending most of the afternoon twiddling pencils and reading and
      rereading two letters out of his pocket instead of righteously thinking up
      layouts for the new United Steel Frame Pulley Campaign. He realizes that
      the layouts are important&mdash;that has been brought to his attention
      already by several pink memoranda from Mr. Délier, the head of the
      department&mdash;but an immense distaste for all things in general and
      advertising in particular has overwhelmed him all day. He looks around the
      big, brightly lighted room with a stupefied sort of loathing&mdash;advertising
      does not suit him&mdash;he is doing all he can at it because of Nancy&mdash;but
      he simply does not seem to get the hang of the thing even after eight
      months odd and he is conscious of the fact that the Powers that be are
      already looking at him with distrustful eyes, in spite of his occasional
      flashes of brilliance. If he could only get <i>out</i> of it&mdash;get
      into something where his particular kind of mind and training would be
      useful&mdash;oh well&mdash;he grunts and turns back to his private
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter from Easten of Columbiac Magazines&mdash;kindly enough&mdash;but
      all hope of selling the serial rights of his novel gone glimmering because
      of it&mdash;Easten was the last chance, the last and the best. &ldquo;If you
      could see your way to making short stories out of the incidents I have
      named, I should be very much interested&mdash;&rdquo; but even so, two short
      stories won't bring in enough to marry on, even if he can do them to
      Easten's satisfaction&mdash;and the novel couldn't come out as a book now
      till late spring&mdash;and Oliver has too many friends who dabble in
      writing to have any more confidence in book royalties than he would have
      in systems for beating the bank at roulette. Well, <i>that's</i> over&mdash;and
      a year's work with it&mdash;and all the dreams he and Nancy had of getting
      married at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those pulley layouts have to be fixed up sometime. What can you say about
      a pulley&mdash;what <i>can</i> you say? &ldquo;The United Steel Frame Pulley&mdash;Oh
      Man, There's a Hog for Work!&rdquo; Oliver turns the cheap phrase in his mind,
      hating its shoddiness, hating the fact that such shoddiness is the only
      stuff with which he can deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanely considered, he supposes he hasn't any business using up a month's
      meagre savings and three small checks for poems that he has hoarded since
      April in going out to St. Louis Friday. Mr. Alley wasn't too pleased with
      letting him take Saturday and half Monday off to do it, too. But then
      there was that telegram ten days ago. &ldquo;I'd give anything in the world if
      we could only see each other&mdash;&rdquo; and after other letters
      unsatisfactorily brief, the letter that came Monday &ldquo;I have such grand
      news, Ollie dear, at least it may be grand if it works out&mdash;but oh,
      dear, I do want to see you about it without tangling it up in letters that
      don't really explain. Can't you make it&mdash;even a few hours would be
      long enough to talk it all over&mdash;and I do so want to see you and
      really talk! Please wire me, if you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grand news&mdash;what kind he wondered&mdash;and dully thought that he
      couldn't see her, of course, and then suddenly knew that he must. After
      all, there didn't seem to be much use in saving for the sake of saving
      when all the saving you could possibly do didn't bring you one real inch
      nearer to what you really wanted. <i>Apres moi le deluge&mdash;apres ca le
      deluge</i>&mdash;it might even come to that this time, they were both so
      tired&mdash;and he viewed the prospect as a man mortally hurt might view
      the gradual failing of sun and sky above him, with hopelessness complete
      as a cloud in that sky, but with heart and brain too beaten now to be
      surprised with either agony or fear. They must see each other&mdash;they
      were neither of them quiet people who could love forever at a distance
      without real hope. Great Lord, if he and Nancy could ever have one
      definite basis to work on, one definite hope of money in the future no
      matter how far off that was&mdash;But the present uncertainty&mdash;They
      couldn't keep on like this&mdash;no two people in the world could be
      expected to keep on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy. He is seeing Nancy, the way she half-lifts her head when she has
      been teasing and suddenly becomes remorseful and wants him to know how
      much she does love him instead.

    <p>
      A hot night in the Pullman&mdash;-too hot to sleep in anything but a
      series of uneasy drowsings and wakings. Smell of blankets and cinders and
      general unwashedness&mdash;noise of clacketing wheels and a hysterical
      whistle&mdash;anyhow each sweaty hour brings St. Louis and Nancy nearer.
      St. <i>Nancy</i>, St. <i>Nancy</i>, St. <i>Nancy</i>, says the sleepless
      racket of the wheels, but the peevish electric fan at the end of the
      corridor keeps buzzing to itself like a fly caught in a trap. &ldquo;And then I
      got married you see&mdash;and then I got married you see&mdash;and when
      you get married you aren't a free lance&mdash;you aren't a free lance&mdash;you're
      <i>settled</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It will have to be pretty grand news indeed that Nancy has to make up for
      this last week and the buzz of the electric fan, thinks Oliver, twisting
      from one side of his stuffy berth to the other like an uneasy sardine.

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More beans, Oliver,&rdquo; says Mrs. Ellicott in a voice like thin syrup, her
      &ldquo;generous&rdquo; voice. The generous voice is used whenever Mrs. Ellicott wants
      to show herself a person of incredibly scrupulous fairness before that
      bodiless assemblage of old women in black that constitute the They who Say&mdash;and
      so it is used to Oliver nearly all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No thank you, Mrs. Ellicott.&rdquo; Oliver manages to look at her politely
      enough as he speaks but then his eyes go straight back to Nancy and stay
      there as if they wished to be considered permanent attachments. All Oliver
      has been able to realize for the last two hours is the mere declarative
      fact that she is <i>there</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Nancy in her turn looks once swiftly at her mother, sitting there at
      the end of the table like a faded grey sparrow whose feathers make it
      uncomfortable. It isn't feathers, though, really&mdash;its only Oliver.
      Why can't mother get reconciled to Oliver&mdash;why <i>can't</i> she&mdash;and
      if she can't, why doesn't she come out and say so instead of trying to be
      generous to Oliver when she doesn't want to while he's there and then
      saying mean things when he's away because she can't help it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stanley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, my dear&mdash;no&mdash;yes, a few, perhaps&mdash;I might
      reconsider&mdash;only a few, my dear,&rdquo;&mdash;his voice does not do
      anything as definite as cease&mdash;it merely becomes ineffectual as Mrs.
      Ellicott heaps his plate. He then looks at the beans as if he hadn't the
      slightest idea where they came from but supposes as long as they are there
      they must be got away with somehow, and starts putting them into his mouth
      as mechanically as if they were pennies and he a slot-machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hot in the Ellicotts' dining-room&mdash;the butter was only brought
      in a little while ago, but already it is yellow mush. There are little
      drops on the backs of Mr. Ellicott's hands. Oliver wants to help Nancy
      take away the dishes and bring in the fruit&mdash;they have started to
      make a game out of it already when Mrs. Ellicott's voice enforces order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Oliver. No, please. Please sit still. It is so seldom we have a <i>guest</i>
      that Nancy and I are apt to forget our <i>manners</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver looks to Nancy for guidance, receives it and subsides into his
      chair. That's just the trouble, he thinks rather peevishly&mdash;if only
      Mrs. Ellicott would stop acting as if he were a guest&mdash;and not
      exactly a guest by choice at that but one who must be the more
      scrupulously entertained in public, the less he is liked in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fruit. Mrs. Ellicott apologizing for it&mdash;her voice implies that
      she is quite sure Oliver doesn't think it good enough for him but that he
      ought to feel himself very lucky indeed that it isn't his deserts instead.
      Mr. Ellicott absent-mindedly squirting orange juice up his sleeve. Oliver
      and Nancy looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the same?&rdquo; say both kinds of eyes, intent, absorbed with the wish
      that has been starved small through the last three months, but now grows
      again like a smoke-tree out of a magicked jar, &ldquo;Really the same and really
      loving me and really glad to be here?&rdquo; But they can get no proper sort of
      answer now&mdash;there are too many other Ellicotts around, especially
      Mrs. Ellicott.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner is over with coffee and cigarettes that Mrs. Ellicott has bought
      for Oliver because no one shall ever say she failed in the smallest
      punctilio of hospitality, though she offers them to him with a gesture
      like that of a missionary returning his baked-mud idol to a Bushman too
      far gone in sin to reclaim. Mr. Ellicott smoked cigarettes before his
      marriage. For twenty years now he has been a contributing member of the
      Anti-Tobacco League.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now all that Oliver knows is that unless he can talk to Nancy soon and
      alone, he will start being very rude. It is not that he wants to be rude&mdash;especially
      to Nancy's family&mdash;but the impulse to get everyone but Nancy away by
      any means from sarcasm to homicidal mania is as reasonless and strong as
      the wish to be born. After all he and Nancy have not seen each other
      wakingly for three months&mdash;and there is still her &ldquo;grand news&rdquo; to
      tell, the grandness of which has seemed to grow more and more dubious the
      longer she looked at Oliver. Now is the time for Mr. and Mrs. Ellicott to
      disappear as casually and completely as clouds over the edge of the sky
      and first of all, not to mention the fact that they are going. But Mrs.
      Ellicott has far too much tact ever to be understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      She puts Mr. Ellicott's hat on for him and takes his arm as firmly as if
      she were police, and he accepts the grasp with the meekness of an old
      offender who is not quite sure what particular crime he is being arrested
      for this time but has an uncomfortable knowledge that it may be any one of
      a dozen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we old people are going to leave you, children alone for a little
      while&rdquo; she announces, fair to the last, her voice sweeter than ever. &ldquo;We
      know you have such a great many important <i>affairs</i> to talk over&mdash;particularly
      the <i>splendid</i> offer that has just come to Nancy&mdash;my little girl
      hasn't told you about it yet, has she, Oliver?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mrs. Ellicott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, her father and myself consider it quite <i>remarkable</i> and we
      have been <i>urging</i>&mdash;very <i>strongly</i>&mdash;her acceptance,
      though of course&rdquo; this with a glacé smile, &ldquo;we realize that we are only
      her <i>parents</i>. And, as Nancy knows, it has always been our dearest
      wish to have her decide matters affecting her happiness entirely <i>herself</i>.
      But I feel sure that when both of you have talked it <i>well</i> over, we
      can trust you both to come to a most <i>reasonable</i> decision.&rdquo; She
      breathes heavily and moves with her appurtenance to the door, secure as an
      ostrich in the belief that Oliver thinks her impartial, even affectionate.
      Her conscientiousness gives her a good deal of applause for leaving the
      two young people so soon when they have all one evening and another
      morning to be together&mdash;but subconsciously she knows that she has
      done her best by her recent little speech to make this talking-it-over a
      walk through a field full of small pestilent burrs, for both Oliver and
      Nancy. They say <i>au revoir</i> very politely&mdash;all four&mdash;the
      door shuts on Mr. Ellicott's meek back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellicott is not very happy, going downstairs. She knows what has
      undoubtedly happened the moment the door was shut&mdash;and a little
      twinge of something very like the taste of sour grapes goes through her as
      she thinks of those two young people so reprehensibly glad at being even
      for the moment in each other's arms.

    <h2>
      XV
    </h2>
    <p>
      An hour later and still the grand news hasn't been told. In fact very
      little that Mrs. Ellicott would regard as either sensible or reasonable
      has happened at all. Though they do not know it the conversation has been
      oddly like that of two dried desert-travellers who have suddenly come upon
      water and for quite a while afterwards find it hard to think of anything
      else. But finally:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest, dearest, what was the grand news?&rdquo; says Oliver half-drowsily.
      &ldquo;We must talk it over, dear, I suppose, I guess, oh, we must&mdash;oh, but
      you're so sweet&mdash;&rdquo; and he relapses again into speechlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are close together, he and she now. Their lips meet&mdash;and meet&mdash;with
      a sweet touch&mdash;with a long pressure&mdash;children being good to each
      other&mdash;cloud mingling with gleaming cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ollie dear.&rdquo; Nancy's voice comes from somewhere as far away and still as
      if she were talking out of a star. &ldquo;Stop kissing me. I can't think when
      you kiss me, I can only feel you be close. If you want to hear about that
      news, that is,&rdquo; she adds, her lips hardly moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that Oliver wants to do is to hold her and be quiet&mdash;to make out
      of the stuffy room, the nervous rushing of noise under the window, the air
      exhausted with heat, a place in some measure peaceful, in some measure
      retired, where they can lie under lucent peace for a moment as shells lie
      in clear water and not be worried about anything any more. But again, the
      time they are to have is too short&mdash;Oliver really must be back Monday
      afternoon&mdash;already he is unpleasantly conscious of the time-table
      part of his mind talking trains at him. He takes his arms from around
      Nancy&mdash;she sits up rubbing her eyes with the back of her hand as if
      to take the dream that was so glittering in them away now she and Oliver
      have to talk business-affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my <i>hair</i>&mdash;lucky it's bobbed, that's all&mdash;I'd have
      lost all the hairpins I ever had in it by now&mdash;Well, Ollie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand goes over to his uneasily, takes hold. For a moment the dream
      comes back and she forgets entirely what she was going to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh <i>dear</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy, Nancy, Nancy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she will be firm about their talking. &ldquo;No, we mustn't really, we
      mustn't, or I can't tell you anything at all. Well, it's this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't tell you about it at all&mdash;didn't even imagine it would come
      to anything. But that old geology specimen Mrs. Winters knows the
      art-editor of &ldquo;The Bazaar&rdquo; and she happened to say so once when she was
      here being gloomy with mother, so I wormed a letter out of her to her
      friend about me. And I sent some things in and the poor man seemed to be
      interested&mdash;at least he said he wanted to see more&mdash;and then we
      started having a real correspondence. Until finally&mdash;it was that
      Friday because I wrote you the letter right away&mdash;he goes and sends
      me a letter saying to come on to New York&mdash;that I can have a regular
      job with them if I want to, and if they like my stuff well enough, after a
      couple of months they'll send me to Paris to do fashions over there and
      pay me a salary I can more than live on and everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy cannot help ending with a good deal of triumph, though there is
      anxiety behind the triumph as well. But to Oliver it seems as if the floor
      had come apart under his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he has failed so ludicrously and completely, Nancy has succeeded and
      succeeded beyond even his own ideas of success. She can go to Paris and
      have all they ever planned together, now; it has all bent down to her like
      an apple on a swinging bough, all hers to take, from lunch at Prunier's
      and sunset over the river to that perfect little apartment they know every
      window of by heart&mdash;and he is no nearer it than he was eight months
      ago. He has felt the pride in her voice and knows it as most human and
      justified, but because he is young and unreasonable that pride of hers
      hurts his own. And then there is something else. All through what she was
      saying it was &ldquo;I&rdquo; that said, not &ldquo;we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's fine, Nancy,&rdquo; he says uncertainly. &ldquo;That's certainly fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she knows by his voice in a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ollie, Ollie, of course I won't take it if it makes you feel that
      way, dear. Why, I wouldn't do anything that would hurt you&mdash;but Ollie
      I don't see how this can, how this could change things any way at all. I
      only thought it would bring things nearer&mdash;both of us getting jobs
      and my having a Paris one and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice might be anything else in the world, but it is not wholly
      convinced. And its being sure beyond bounds is the only thing that could
      possibly help Oliver. He puts his hands on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't do anything but tell you to take it, dearest, could I? When
      it's such a real chance?&rdquo; He is hoping with illogical but none the less
      painful desperation that she will deny him. But she nods instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, Nancy dear, listen. If you take it, we've got to face things,
      haven't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nods a little rebelliously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why is it so <i>serious</i>, Ollie?&rdquo; and again her voice is not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know. Because I've failed&mdash;God knows when I'll make enough money
      for us to get married now&mdash;with the novel gone bust and everything.
      And I haven't any right to keep you like this when I'm not sure of ever
      being able to marry you&mdash;and when you've got a job like this and can
      go right ahead on the things you've always been crazy to do. Nancy, you <i>want</i>
      to take it&mdash;even if it meant our not getting married for another year
      and your being away&mdash;don't you, don't you? Oh, Nancy, you've <i>got</i>
      to tell me&mdash;it'll only bust everything we've had already if you
      don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now they have come to a point of misunderstanding that only a trust as
      unreasonable as belief in immortality will help. But that trust could
      never be bothered with the truth of what it was saying at the moment&mdash;it
      would have to reach into something deeper than any transitory feeling&mdash;and
      they have an unlucky tradition of always trying to tell each other what is
      exactly true. And so Nancy nods because she has to, though she couldn't
      bear to put what that means into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you take it. And I'm awful sorry we couldn't make it go, dear. I
      tried as hard as I could to make it go but I guess I didn't have the
      stuff, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He has risen now and his face seems curiously twisted&mdash;twisted as if
      something hot and hurtful had passed over it and left it so that it would
      always look that way. He can hardly bear to look at Nancy, but she has
      risen and started talking hurriedly&mdash;fright, amazement, concern and a
      queer little touch of relief all mixing in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Ollie, if you can't <i>trust</i> me about something as little as
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't that,&rdquo; he says beatenly and she knows it isn't. And knowing, her
      voice becomes suddenly frightened&mdash;the fright of a child who has let
      something as fragile and precious as a vessel of golden glass slip out of
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Ollie dear! But, Ollie, I never meant it that way. But Ollie, I love
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He takes her in his arms again and they kiss long. This time though there
      is no peace in the kiss, only the lost passion of bodies tired beyond
      speech. &ldquo;Do you love me, Nancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she has to decide&mdash;and the truth that will not matter for more
      than the hour wins. Besides, he has hurt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ollie, Ollie, yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not sure any more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not being certain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the way it was at first&mdash;but, Ollie, we're neither of us the
      same&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you <i>aren't</i> sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't&mdash;I haven't&mdash;oh, Ollie, I don't know, I don't know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the kiss but this time their lips only hurt against each other&mdash;Oliver
      feels for a ghastly instant as if he were kissing Nancy after she had
      died. It seems to him that everything in him has made itself into a
      question as discordant and unanswered as the tearing cry of a puppy baying
      the moon, struck out of his senses by that swimming round silver above
      him, ineffably lustrous, ineffably removed, none of it ever coming to
      touch him but light too pale to help at all. He is holding a girl in his
      arms&mdash;he can feel her body against him&mdash;but it is not Nancy he
      is holding&mdash;it never will be Nancy any more. He releases her and
      starts walking up and down in a series of short, uneasy strides, turning
      mechanically to keep out of the way of chairs. Words come out of him,
      words he never imagined he could ever say, he thinks dizzily that it would
      feel like this if he were invisibly bleeding to death&mdash;that would
      come the same way in fiery spurts and pauses that tore at the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see, dear, don't you <i>see</i>? It's been eight months now and
      we aren't any nearer getting married than we were at first and it isn't
      honest to say we will be soon any more&mdash;I can't see any prospect&mdash;I've
      failed in everything I thought would go&mdash;and we can't get married on
      my job for <i>years</i>&mdash;I'm not good enough at it&mdash;and I <i>won't</i>
      have you hurt&mdash;I <i>won't</i> have you tied to me when it only means
      neither of us doing what we want and both of us getting, older and our
      work not done. Oh, I love you, Nancy&mdash;if there was any hope at all
      I'd go down on my knees to ask you to keep on but there isn't&mdash;they've
      beaten us&mdash;they've beaten us&mdash;all the fat old people who told us
      we were too poor and too young. All we do is go on like this both of us
      getting worked up whenever we see each other and both of us hurting each
      other and nothing happening&mdash;Oh, Nancy, I thought we could help each
      other always and now we can't even [Illustration: AND THEN THE QUEER MAN
      HAD GONE OUT OF THE DOOR] a little any more. You remember when we promised
      that if either of us stopping loving each other we'd tell?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy is very silent and rather white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Ollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Nancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They look at each other as if they were watching each other burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by darling, darling, darling!&rdquo; says Ollie through lips like a
      marionette's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Nancy feels him take hold of her again&mdash;the arms of somebody
      else in Oliver's body&mdash;and a cold mouth hurting her cheek&mdash;and
      still she cannot speak. And then the queer man who was walking up and down
      so disturbingly has gone out of the door.

    <h2>
      XVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver finds himself walking along a long street in a city. It is not a
      distinguished street by any means&mdash;there are neither plate-glass
      shops nor 'residences' on it&mdash;just an ordinary street of little
      stores and small houses and occasionally an apartment building named for a
      Pullman car. In a good many houses the lights are out already&mdash;it is
      nearly eleven o'clock and this part of St. Louis goes to bed early&mdash;only
      the drugstores and the moving-picture theatres are still flaringly awake.
      His eyes read the sign that he passes mechanically, &ldquo;Dr. Edwin K.
      Buffinton&mdash;Chiropractor,&rdquo; &ldquo;McMurphy and Kane's,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rossiter,&rdquo; with
      its pillars that look as if they had been molded out of marbled soap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thought. Memory. Pain. Pain pressing down on his eyeballs like an iron
      thumb, twisting wires around his forehead tighter and tighter till it's
      funny the people he passes don't see the patterns they make on his skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody talking in his mind, quite steadily and flatly, repeating and
      repeating itself like a piece of cheap music played over and over again on
      a scratched phonograph record, talking in the voice that is a composite of
      a dozen voices; a fat man comfortable on a club lounge laying down the law
      as if he were carefully smearing the shine out of something brilliant with
      a flaccid heavy finger; a thin sour woman telling children playing
      together &ldquo;don't, don't, don't,&rdquo; in the whine of a nasty nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All for the best, you know&mdash;all for the best, we're all of us sure
      of that. Love doesn't last&mdash;doesn't last&mdash;doesn't last&mdash;as
      good fish in the sea as ever were caught out of it&mdash;nobody's heart
      could break at twenty-five. You think you're happy and proud&mdash;you
      think you're lovers and friends&mdash;but that doesn't last, doesn't last,
      doesn't last&mdash;none of it lasts at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If he only weren't so <i>tired</i> he could do something. But instead he
      feels only as a man feels who has been drinking all day in the instant
      before complete intoxication&mdash;his body is as distinct from him as if
      it were walking behind him with his shadow&mdash;all the colors he sees
      seem exaggeratedly dull or brilliant, he has little sense of distance, the
      next street corner may be a block or a mile away, it is all the same, his
      feet will take him there, his feet that keep going mechanically, one after
      the other, one after the other, as if they marched to a clock. There is no
      feeling in him that stays long enough to be called by any definite word&mdash;there
      is only a streaming parade of sensations like blind men running through
      mist, shapes that come out of fog and sink back to it, without sight,
      without number, without name, with only continual hurry of feet to tell of
      their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slinky man comes up at his elbow and starts to talk out of the side of
      his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, mister&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>go</i> to hell!&rdquo; and the man fades away again, without even
      looking startled, to mutter &ldquo;Well, you needn' be so damn peeved about it&mdash;I'll
      say you needn' be so damn peeved&mdash;whatcha think you are, anyhow&mdash;Marathon
      Mike?&rdquo; as Oliver's feet take Oliver swiftly away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy. The first time he ever kissed her when it was question and answer
      with neither of them sure. And then getting surer and surer&mdash;and then
      when they kissed. Never touching Nancy, never. Never seeing her again
      never any more. That song the Glee Club used to harmonize over&mdash;what
      was it?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  We won't go there any more,
  We won't go there any more
  We won't go there any mo-o-ore&mdash;&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      He lifts his eyes for a moment. A large blue policeman is looking at him
      fixedly from the other side of the street, his nightstick twirling in a
      very prepared sort of way. For an instant Oliver sees himself going over
      and asking that policeman for his helmet to play with. That would be the
      cream of the jest&mdash;the very cream&mdash;to end the evening in combat
      with a large blue policeman after having all you wanted in life break
      under you suddenly like new ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been walking for a very long time. He ought to go to bed. He had a
      hotel somewhere if he could only think where. The policeman might know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman saw a young man with staring eyes coming toward him,
      remarked &ldquo;hophead&rdquo; internally and played with his nightstick a little
      more. The nearer Oliver came the larger and more unsympathetic the
      policeman seemed to him. Still, if you couldn't remember what your hotel
      was yourself it was only sensible to ask guidance on the question. His
      mind reacted suddenly toward grotesqueness. One had to be very polite to
      large policemen. The politeness should, naturally, increase as the square
      of the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you could tell me where my hotel is, officer?&rdquo; Oliver began.
      &ldquo;What hotel?&rdquo; said the policeman uninterestedly. Oliver noticed with an
      inane distinctness that he had started to swirl his nightstick as a large
      blue cat might switch its tail. He wondered if it would be tactful to ask
      him if he had ever been a drum major. Then he realized that the policeman
      had asked him a question&mdash;courtesy demanded a prompt response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said 'What hotel?'&rdquo; The policeman was beginning to be annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver started to think of his hotel. It was imbecile not to remember the
      name of your own hotel&mdash;even when your own particular material and
      immaterial cosmos had been telescoped like a toy train in the last three
      hours. The Rossiter was all that he could think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Rossiter,&rdquo; he said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hotel Rossiter in <i>this</i> town.&rdquo; The policeman's nightstick was
      getting more and more irritated. &ldquo;Rossiter's a lotta flats. You live
      there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I live in a hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I tell you I don't remember,&rdquo; said Oliver vaguely. &ldquo;A big one with a
      lot of electric lights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The policeman's face became suddenly very red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you move on, buddy!&rdquo; he said in a tone of hoarse displeasure. &ldquo;You
      move right on! You don't come around me with any of your funny cracks&mdash;I
      know whatsa matter with you, all right, all right. I know whatsa matter
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo; Oliver was smiling a little now, the whole scene was so
      arabesque. &ldquo;I want to go to my hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You move on. You move on <i>quick</i>!&rdquo; said the policeman vastly. &ldquo;It's
      a long walk down to the hoosegow and <i>I</i> don't want to take you
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to go there,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;But my hotel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Quit arguin'&rdquo;</i>! said the policeman in a bark like a teased bulldog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver turned and walked two steps away. Then he turned again. After all
      why not? The important part of his life was over anyhow&mdash;and before
      the rest of it finished he might be able to tell one large policeman just
      what he thought of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you big blue boob,&rdquo; he began abruptly with a sense of pleasant
      refreshment better than drink, &ldquo;You great heaving purple ice wagon&mdash;&rdquo;
       and then he was stopped abruptly for the policeman was taking the
      necessary breath away.

    <h2>
      XVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      About which time Nancy had finished crying&mdash;raging at herself all the
      time, she hated to cry so&mdash;and was sitting up straight on the couch
      looking at the door which Oliver had shut as if by looking it very hard
      indeed she could make it turn into Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <i>couldn't</i> end this way. If it did it just meant that all the last
      year wasn't real&mdash;hadn't any more part in reality than charity
      theatricals. And they'd both of them been so sure that it was the chief
      reality that they had ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wasn't <i>reasonable</i>. She hadn't wanted the darned old job, she'd
      wanted to marry him, but as long as they hadn't seemed to get very far in
      the last eight months when he'd been trying to work it&mdash;why couldn't
      <i>she</i> try&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then 'Oh Nancy, be honest!' to herself. No, that wasn't true. She'd wanted
      the job, wanted to get it, hadn't thought about Oliver particularly when
      she'd tried for it except to be a little impatient with him for not using
      more judgment when he picked out his job. Did that mean that she didn't
      love him? Oh Lord, it was all so mixed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting out so clearly at first and everything being so perfect&mdash;and
      then the last four months and both getting tireder and tireder and all the
      useless little misunderstandings that made you wonder how could you if you
      really cared. And now this.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant of mere relief from strain Nancy saw herself in Paris,
      studying as she had always wanted to study, doing some real work, all
      Paris hers to play with like a big gray stone toy, never having to worry
      about loving, about being loved, about people you loved. Being free. Like
      taking off your hot, hot clothes and lying in water when you were too hot
      and tired even to think of sleeping. Oliver too&mdash;she'd leave him free&mdash;he'd
      really work better without her&mdash;without having her to take care of
      and make money for and worry about always&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The mind turned the other way. But what would doing anything be like with
      Oliver out of it when doing things together had been all that mattered all
      the last year?
    </p>
    <p>
      They couldn't decide things like this on a prickly hot August night when
      both of them were nearly dead with fatigue. It wasn't <i>real</i>. Even
      after Oliver had shut the door she'd been sure he'd come back, though she
      hoped he wouldn't just while she was crying; she never had been, she
      thought viciously, one of those happy people who look like rain-goddesses
      when they cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must come back. She shut her eyes and told him to as hard as she could.
      But he didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      All very well to be proud and dignified when both of you lived near each
      other. But Oliver was going back to New York tomorrow&mdash;and if he went
      back while they were still like this&mdash;She knew his train&mdash;the
      ten seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried being proud in a dozen different expressive attitudes for ten
      minutes or so: Then she suddenly relaxed and went over to the telephone,
      smiling rather ashamedly at herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hotel Rosario?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I speak to Mr. Oliver Crowe? He is staying there isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A pause full of little jingling sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he's staying here but he hasn't come in yet this evening. Do you
      wish to leave a message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy hesitates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-no.&rdquo; That would be just a little too humble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the name of the party calling?&rdquo; He will know, of course. Still, had
      she better say? Then she remembers the need of punishing him just a
      little. After all&mdash;it is hardly fair she should go all the way toward
      making up when he hasn't even started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no name. But tell him somebody called, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Nancy goes back to wonder if the reason Oliver hasn't gone back to the
      hotel is that he is returning here in an appropriate suit of sackcloth.
      She hopes he <i>will</i> come before mother and father get back.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even while she is hoping it, the large blue policeman is saying
      something about &ldquo;'Sturbance of the peace&rdquo; to the desk-sergeant, and Oliver
      is going down on the blotter as Donald Richardson.

    <h2>
      XVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You simply must not worry yourself about it so, Nancy, my darling,&rdquo; says
      Mrs. Ellicott brightly. &ldquo;Lovers' quarrels are only lovers' quarrels you
      know and they seem very small indeed to people a little older and more
      experienced though I daresay they may loom terribly large just at present.
      Why your father and myself used to have&mdash;ahem&mdash;our little times
      over <i>trifles</i>, darling, mere <i>trifles </i>&rdquo; and Mrs. Ellicott
      takes a pinch of air between finger and thumb as if to display it as a
      specimen of those mere trifles over which Mr. and Mrs. Ellicott used to
      become proudly enraged at each other in the days before she had faded him
      so completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, after a night of intensive sleeplessness broken only by dreams of
      seeing Oliver being married to somebody else in the lobby of the Hotel
      Rosario can only wonder rather dully when it could ever have been that
      poor father was allowed enough initiative of his own to take even the
      passive part in a quarrel over a trifle and why mother thinks the prospect
      implied in her speech of her daughter's marriage being like unto hers can
      be so comforting. Nancy made one New Year's resolution the second day of
      her engagement, &ldquo;If I ever find myself starting to act to Ollie the way
      mother does to father I'll simply have to leave him and never see him
      again.&rdquo; But Mrs. Ellicott goes on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Oliver is at all the sort of young man we must hope he is, he will
      certainly come and apologize at once. And if he should not&mdash;well
      Nancy, my little girl,&rdquo; she adds hieroglyphically &ldquo;there are many trials
      that seem hard to bear at first which prove true blessings later when we
      see of what false materials they were first composed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ellicott thinks it is time for him to go to the office. It is five
      minutes ahead of his usual time but Mrs. Ellicott has been looking at him
      all the way through her last speech until he feels uneasily that he must
      be composed of very false material indeed. He stops first though to give
      an ineffective pat to Nancy's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, Chick,&rdquo; he says kindly. &ldquo;Always sun somewhere you know, so
      don't treat the poor boy too hard,&rdquo; and he shuffles rapidly away before
      his wife can look all the way through him for the vague heresy implicit in
      his sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all very well for your father to say such things, but, Nancy,
      darling, you shall not be put upon by Tramplers&rdquo; proceeds Mrs. Ellicott in
      her most cryptically perfect tones. &ldquo;Oliver is a man&mdash;he must
      apologize. A man, I say, though little more than a boy. And otherwise you
      would now be pursuing your Art in Paris due to dear kind Mrs. Winters who
      has always stood our truest friend and now this other opportunity has come
      also but I would never be the first to say that even such should not be
      sacrificed most gladly for the love of a true kind husband and dear little
      children though marriage is but a lottery at best and especially when
      affections are fixed upon their object in early youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this without a pause, pouring over the numbed parts of Nancy's mind
      like thin sweetish oil. Nancy considers wearily. Yes, Oliver should
      apologize. Yes, it is only being properly dignified not to call up the
      Rosario again to find if he is there. Yes, if he truly loves her, he will
      call&mdash;he will come&mdash;and the clock hands are marching on toward
      ten-seven and his train like stiff little soldiers and mother is talking,
      talking&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I wish or have wished to influence your mind in any way, my
      darling, but environment and propinquity count for mountains in such first
      youthful attachments and sometimes when we are older to be looked back
      upon with such regret. Nor would I ever have Words Spoken that should seem
      to injure the choice of my daughter's heart&mdash;but when young men
      cannot provide even Hovels for their <i>fiancées</i> a reasonable time
      having been given, it is only just that they should release them and you
      looking like death all these last two months. Never wishing that my own
      daughter should act in Ways dishonorable in the slightest but time is the
      Test in such matters and if such tests are not to be survived it is best
      they should end and no one can deny that the young man talks very queerly
      and was often quite disrespectful to you though you may say that was
      joking but it would not have been joking in my day and young men with
      queer nervous eyes and hands I never have nor will quite trust&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it's Oliver that's doing this, Oliver who turned funny and white when
      she cut her finger with the breadknife making sandwiches and wanted her to
      put all sorts of things on it. Oliver who was always so sweet when she was
      unreasonable and always the first to come looking unhappy after they'd
      quarrelled even a little and say it was all his fault. Why the very last
      letter she got from him was the one that said if she ever stopped loving
      him he knew he'd die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when things are ended it is better that such things should be though
      doubtless not necessary to put an announcement in the paper yet since God
      in his infinite wisdom arranges all things for the best. And with such a
      splendid position opening before her it would be only dignified to bring
      the young man to his senses for it would not be right to let unreasonable
      young men stand in the way of advantages offered by Foreign Travel and
      study and these things are soon forgotten, my dear, and if nervous young
      men will not admit like gentlemen that they are in the wrong when only
      engaged what kind of husbands will they make when married forever? And is
      not a broken engagement better than lifelong unhappiness when there are so
      many too many sinful people divorcing each other every day and all men who
      write for their living use stimulants, my dear, such is literary history
      and my dearest have your cry out on mother's shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sweetish oil has risen about Nancy relentlessly&mdash;it is up to her
      waist now and still it keeps talking and flowing and creeping higher. Very
      soon when the fatter black soldier on the clock-face has only hitched
      himself along a little, it will be over her head and the roving Nancy, the
      sparkling Nancy, the Nancy that fell in love will be under it like a calm
      body, never to rise or run or be kissed with light seeking kisses on the
      soft of her throat again. There will only be a dignified Nancy, a sensible
      Nancy, a Nancy going to Paris to study and be successful, a Nancy who,
      sooner or later will marry &ldquo;Some good, clean man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little tinkle of chimes from the clock. Six minutes more. The Nancy that
      was stands on tiptoe, every eager and tameless bit of her hoping, hoping.
      If mother weren't there that Nancy would have been at the telephone an
      hour ago in spite of young people's pride and old people's self-respect
      and all the thousand and one knife-faced fetishes that all the correct and
      common-sensible people hug close and worship because they hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She can see the train sliding out of the station. Ollie is in it and his
      face is stiff with surprise and unforgiveness like the face of some
      horrible stranger you went up to and spoke to by mistake, thinking he was
      your friend. By the time the train is well started he will have begun
      talking to that fluffy girl in the other half of the Pullman&mdash;no,
      that isn't worthy, he wouldn't&mdash;but oh Ollie, Ollie!
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the telephone rings. Nancy is finishing the breakfast
      dishes&mdash;her hands jump as she hears it&mdash;a slippery plate slops
      back into the water and as she dives after it she realizes painfully that
      the new water is much too hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>is</i> it, mother?&rdquo; For an instant the Nancy who has no real
      self-respect is talking again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a minute, Isabella. Mrs. Winters, dear. Don't you want to speak to
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not right now. When I'm through with these. But will you ask her if she's
      going to be in this afternoon&mdash;I want to tell her about my taking the
      New York job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied oil pouring back into the telephone with a pleased, thin
      chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Nancy has decided. Well, dear, I think she had better tell you
      herself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy is looking dolefully down at her thumb. Foolish not to have cooled
      off that water a little&mdash;she has really burned herself. For an
      instant she hears Oliver's voice in her ears, low and concerned, sees
      Oliver kissing it, making it well. But these things don't happen to
      sensible, self-respecting modern girls with experienced mothers,
      especially when all the former have now quite made up their own minds.

    <h2>
      XIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was with some nightmare surprise that Oliver on waking regarded his
      tidy cell. Then he remembered and in spite of the fact that yesterday
      evening with all that belonged to it kept hurting wherever it was that
      most of him lived with the stiff repeating ache of a nerve struck again
      and again by the same soft hammer, he couldn't help laughing a little. The
      popular college remedy for disprized love had always been an instantaneous
      mingling of conflicting alcohols&mdash;calling a large policeman a big
      blue boob seemed to produce the same desired result of bringing one to
      one's senses by first taking one completely out of them without the
      revolving stomach and fuzzed mind of the first instance. He tried to think
      of yesterday evening airily. Silly children quarreling about things that
      didn't matter at all. Of course Nancy should have the job if she wanted&mdash;of
      course he'd apologize, apologize like Ecclesiastes even for being alive at
      all if it was necessary&mdash;and then everything would be <i>all</i>
      right, just all right and fixed. But the airy attitude somehow failed to
      comfort&mdash;it was a little too much like trying to shuffle a soft-shoe
      clog on a new grave. Nancy <i>had</i> been unreasonable. Nancy <i>had</i>
      said or hadn't denied that she wasn't sure she loved him any more. He <i>had</i>
      released her from the engagement and told her good-by. He stared at the
      facts&mdash;they sprang up in front of him like choking thorns&mdash;thorns
      he had to clear away with his hands before he could even touch Nancy
      again. Was he sure&mdash;even now? All the airiness dropped from him like
      a clown's false face. As he thought of what would happen if Nancy had
      really meant it about not loving him, it seemed to him that somebody had
      taken away the pit of his stomach and left nothing in its place but air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow the first thing to do was to get out of this place&mdash;he
      examined the neat bars in the door approvingly and wondered how the devil
      you acted when you wanted to be let out. There wasn't any way of opening a
      conversation about it with no one to talk to&mdash;and the corridor was
      merely a length of empty steel&mdash;and, damn it, his train left at Ten
      Seven and he had to see Nancy and explain everything in the world before
      it left&mdash;and if he didn't get back to New York in time he might lose
      his job. There must be some way of explaining to the people in charge that
      he hadn't done anything but kid a policeman&mdash;that he must get out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went over to the door and tried it tentatively&mdash;no inside
      doorknob, of course, this wasn't a hotel. He looked through the bars&mdash;nothing
      but corridor and the cell on the other side. Should he call? For an
      instant the fantastic idea of crying &ldquo;Waiter!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Please send up my
      breakfast!&rdquo; tugged at him hard, but fantasy had got him into much too much
      trouble as it was, he reflected savagely. It made you feel ridiculously
      self-conscious, standing behind bars like this and shouting into
      emptiness. Still he had to get out. He cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he remarked in a pleasant conversational tone. &ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer, he grew bolder.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo;</i> This time the conversational tone was italicized. A rustle
      of voices somewhere rewarded him&mdash;that must be people talking. Well,
      if they talked, they could listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;HEY!&rdquo; and now his voice was emphatic enough for headline capitals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rustle of voices ceased. There was a moment of stupefied silence.
      Then,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SHUT UP!&rdquo; came from the end of the corridor in a roar that made Oliver
      feel as if he had been cooing. The roar irritated him&mdash;they might be
      a little more mannerly. He clutched the bars and discovered to his pleased
      surprise that they would rattle. He shook them as hard as he could like a
      monkey asking for peanuts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey there! I want to get out!&rdquo; and though he tried to make his voice as
      impressive as possible it seemed to him to pipe like a canary's in that
      long steel emptiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to catch a train!&rdquo; he added desperately and then had to stuff
      his coat sleeve into his mouth to keep from spoiling his dramatics with
      most unseasonable mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were noises from the end of the corridor&mdash;the noises of strong
      men at bitter war with something stronger than they, strange rumblings and
      snortings and muffled whoops. Then the voice came again and this time its
      words were slow and deliberately spaced so as to give it time to master
      whatever rocked it between whiles.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Say&mdash;you&mdash;<i>humorist</i>&rdquo; said the voice and here it rose sharply
into an undignified squawk of laughter, &ldquo;You&mdash;innercent
child&mdash;comedian&mdash;you&mdash;Charlie&mdash;Chaplin&mdash;of the&mdash;hoosegow&mdash;you
 <i>shut</i> up&mdash;or I'll come down there and&mdash;bend&mdash;something&mdash;over&mdash;your
merry little face&mdash;<i>understand?</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes sir,&rdquo; said Oliver subduedly.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah right. Now go bye-bye&mdash;mama'll call you when she's ready to take
      you walking&rdquo; then explosively &ldquo;I got to catch a train! Oh Holy Mike!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver left the window and went back toward his bunk, considerably
      chastened. As he did so a bundle of second-hand clothes on the floor
      rolled over and disclosed a red and unshaven face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wup!&rdquo; said Oliver&mdash;he had almost stepped on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha'?&rdquo; said the bundle, opening sick eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh nothing. I only said good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After incredible difficulties, the bundle attained a sitting position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You kid'n me?&rdquo; it demanded thickly, looking at Oliver with as much
      surprise as if he had just grown up out of the floor like a plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no. No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're <i>nah</i> kid'n me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah ri'. 'S countersign. Pass. Fren'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It attempted a military gesture but succeeded merely in hitting its mouth
      with its hand. It then looked at the hand as if the latter had done it on
      purpose and became sunk in profound cogitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not feeling very well today?&rdquo; Oliver ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Well?</i>&rdquo; it said briefly. Then, after a silence devoted to trying to
      find where its hands were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hoosh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hoosh</i>. Goo' hoosh. Gran' hoosh. Oh, <i>hoosh!</i>&rdquo; and as if the
      mention of the word had stricken it back into clothes again it slid slowly
      down on its back, closed its eyes and began to snore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, perched on his bunk for what comfort there was, sat and
      considered. He looked at the bundle&mdash;the bars&mdash;the bars&mdash;the
      bundle. The bundle wheezed apoplectically&mdash;no sound of footsteps came
      from beyond the bars. Oliver wondered if Nancy loved him. He wondered if
      he would ever catch that Ten Seven. But most of all he wondered why on
      earth he had happened to get in here and how on earth he was ever going to
      get out.

    <h2>
      XX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sky had been a blue steam all day, but at night it quieted, there were
      faint airs. From the window of the apartment on Riverside Drive you could
      see it grow gentle, fade from a strong heat of azure through gray gauze
      into darkness, thick-soft as a sable's fur at first, then uneasily
      patterned all at once with idle leopard-spottings and strokes of light.
      The lights fell into the river and dissolved, the dark wash took them and
      carried them into streaks of lesser, more fluid light. Even so, if there
      could have been country silence for five minutes at a time, the running
      river, the hills so disturbed with light beyond, might have worn some
      aspect of peace. But even in the high bird's nest of the apartment there
      was no real silence, only a pretending at silence, like the forced quiet
      of a child told to keep still in a corner&mdash;the two people dining
      together could talk in whispers, if they wanted, and still be heard, but
      always at the back of the brain of either ran a thin pulsation of mumbling
      sound like the buzz of a kettle-drum softly struck in a passage of music
      where the orchestra talks full-voiced&mdash;the night sound of the city,
      breathing and moving and saying words.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must have been married rather contentedly for quite a while now, they
      said so little of importance at dinner and yet seemed so quietly pleased
      at having dinner together and so neat at understanding half sentences
      without asking explanations. That would have been the first conclusion of
      anybody who had been able to take out a wall and watch their doll-house
      unobserved. Besides, though the short, decided man with the greyish hair
      must be fifty at least, the woman who stood his own height when she rose
      from the table was too slimly mature for anything but the thirties. Not a
      highly original New York couple by any means&mdash;a prospering banker or
      president of a Consolidated Toothpick Company with a beautiful wife,
      American matron-without-children model, except for her chin which was less
      dimpled than cleft with decisiveness and the wholly original lustre of her
      hair, a buried lustre like the shine of &ldquo;Murray's red gold&rdquo; in a Border
      ballad. A wife rather less society-stricken than the run of such wives
      since she obviously preferred hot August in a New York apartment with her
      husband's company to beach-picnics at Greenwich or Southampton without it.
      Still the apartment, though compact as an army mess-kit, was perfectly
      furnished and the maid who had served the cool little dinner an efficient
      effacedness of the race that housekeepers with large families and little
      money assert passed with the Spanish War. Money enough, and the knowledge
      of how to use it without blatancy or pinching&mdash;that would have been
      the second conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were sitting in deep chairs in the living room now, a tall-stemmed
      reading lamp glowing softly between them, hardly speaking. The tiredness
      that had been in the man's face like the writing in a 'crossed' letter
      began to leave it softly. He reached over, took the woman's hand and held
      it&mdash;not closely or with greediness but with a firm clasp that had
      something weary like appeal in it and something strong like a knowledge of
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always like this, at home,&rdquo; he said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> rather sweet.&rdquo; Her voice had the gentleness of water running
      into water. Her eyes looked at him once and left him deliberately but not
      as if they didn't care. It must have been a love-match in the beginning
      then&mdash;her eyes seemed so infirm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll read a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home,&rdquo; he said. He seemed queerly satisfied to say the word, queerly
      moved as if even after so much reality had been lived through together, he
      couldn't quite believe that it was reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've been waiting for it&mdash;five days, six days, this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She must have been at the seashore after all&mdash;tan or lack of it meant
      little these days, especially to a woman who lived in this kind of an
      apartment. The third conclusion might have been rather sentimental, a
      title out of a moving picture&mdash;something about Even in the Wastes of
      the Giant City the Weary Heart Will Always Turn To&mdash;Just Home.
    </p>
    <p>
      A doll on a small table began to buzz mysteriously in its internals. The
      man released the woman's hand&mdash;both looking deeply annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought we had a private number here,&rdquo; said the man, the tiredness
      coming back into his face like scribbles on parchment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed to the telephone with a charming furtiveness&mdash;you could
      see she was playing they had just been found behind the piano together in
      a game of hide-and-seek. The doll was disembowelled of its telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;No&mdash;Oh very well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the Eclair Picture Palace?&rdquo; she mimicked. [Illustration: THE
      TIREDNESS THAT HAD BEEN IN THE MAN'S FACE BEGAN TO LEAVE IT] Both seemed
      almost childishly relieved. So in spite of his successful-business-man
      mouth, he wasn't the kind that is less a husband than a
      telephone-receiver, especially at home. Still, she would have made a
      difference even to telephone-receivers, that could be felt even without
      the usual complement of senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was&mdash;bothersome for a minute.&rdquo; His tone lent the words a quaint
      accent of scare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;if you have one at all&mdash;the way the service is now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There won't be any telephone when we take our vacation together, that's
      <i>settled</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had been kneeling, examining a bookcase for books. Now she turned with
      one in her hand, her hair ruddy and smooth as ruddy amber in the reflected
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but <i>telegrams</i>. And wireless,&rdquo; she whispered mockingly, the
      more mockingly because it so obviously made him worried as a worried boy.
      She came over and stood smoothing his ear a moment, a half-unconscious
      customary gesture, no doubt, for he relaxed under it and the look of rest
      came back. Then she went to her chair, sat down and opened the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use borrowing trouble now, dear. Now listen. Cigar?&rdquo; &ldquo;Going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ashtray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And remember not to knock it over when you get excited. Promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Severance's even voice began to flow into the stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt&mdash;&rdquo;

    <h2>

    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's the end of the chapter.&rdquo; Mrs. Severance's voice trailed off
      into silence. She closed the book with a soft sound. The man whom it might
      be rather more convenient than otherwise to call Mr. Severance opened his
      eyes. He had not been asleep, but he had found by a good deal of
      experience that he paid more attention to Dickens if he closed his eyes
      while she read.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. You know I love it. Especially Pip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a word one of my young men used the other day about Dickens.
      Gusto, I think&mdash;yes, that was it. Well, I find that, as I grow older,
      that seems to be the thing I value rather more than most men of my age.
      Gusto.&rdquo; He smiled &ldquo;Though I take it more quietly, perhaps,&mdash;than I
      did when I was young,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> young&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not really, dear. I can give half-a-dozen youngsters I know four strokes
      in nine holes and beat them. I can handle the bank in half the time and
      with half the worry that some of my people take to one department. And for
      a little while more, Rose, I may be able to satisfy you. But&rdquo; and he
      passed a hand lightly over his hair. &ldquo;It's grey, you know,&rdquo; he ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if it mattered,&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance, a little pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does matter, Rose.&rdquo; His eyes darkened with memory&mdash;with the sort
      of memory that hurts more to forget than even to remember. &ldquo;Do you realize
      that I am sixteen years older than you are?&rdquo; he said a little hurriedly as
      if he were trying to scribble the memory over with any kind of words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my dear&rdquo; and she smiled, &ldquo;you were sixteen years older six years ago&mdash;remember?
      There's less real difference between us now than there was then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I certainly wasn't as young in some ways&mdash;six years ago.&rdquo; He
      seemed to speak almost as if unconsciously, almost as if the words were
      being squeezed out of him in sleep by a thing that had pressed for a long
      time with a steady weight on his mind till the mind must release itself or
      be broken. &ldquo;But then nobody could be with you, for a month even, and not
      feel himself turn younger whether he wanted to or not.&rdquo; &ldquo;So that's
      settled.&rdquo; She was trying to carry it lightly, to take the darkness out of
      his eyes. &ldquo;And once you've bought our steamer tickets we can leave it all
      behind at the wharf and by the time we land we'll be so disgracefully
      young that no one will recognize us&mdash;just think&mdash;we can keep
      going back and back till I'm putting my hair up for the first time and
      you're in little short trousers&mdash;and then babies, I suppose and the
      other side of getting born&mdash;&rdquo; but her voice, for once, turned
      ineffectually against his centeredness of gaze, that seemed now as if it
      had turned back on itself for a struggling moment and regarded neither
      what was nor what might be, but only what was past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six years ago&rdquo; he said with the same drowsy thoughtfulness. &ldquo;Well, Rose,
      I shall always be&mdash;most grateful&mdash;for those six years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started to speak but he checked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I would be willing to make a substantial endowment to any
      Protestant Church that still really believed in hell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;because
      that was very like hell&mdash;six years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Intensity began to come into his voice like a color of darkness, though he
      still spoke slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can stand nearly everything in life but being tired of yourself. And
      six years ago I was tired&mdash;tired to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hand reached over and touched him medicinally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I had no right&rdquo; he began again and then stopped. &ldquo;No, I think
      the strong man tires less easily but more wholly than the weak one when he
      does tire. And I was strong enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd played a big game, you know. When my father died we hadn't much left
      but position&mdash;and that was going. I don't blame my father&mdash;he
      wasn't a business man&mdash;he should have been a literary critic&mdash;that
      little book of essays of his still sells, you know; not much but there's a
      demand for a dozen copies every year and that's a good deal for an
      American who's been dead for thirty. Well, that's where the children get
      their liking for things like that&mdash;I've got it too, a little&mdash;I
      could have done something there if I'd had time. But I never had time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could have done it when I got out of Harvard&mdash;drifted along like
      half a dozen people I know, played at law, played at writing, played
      always and forever at being a gentleman&mdash;ended up as an officer of
      the Century Club with what little money I had in an annuity. But I
      couldn't stand the idea of just scraping along. And for nearly ten years I
      put those things aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know about my going West and the way I lived there. It wasn't easy
      when I'd been at Harvard and gone everywhere in New York and Boston&mdash;starting
      in so far below the bottom that you couldn't even see the bottom unless
      you squinted your eyes. But I never took a job with more money if I
      thought I could learn anything in a job with less&mdash;and every place I
      went I stayed until I could handle the job of the man two places ahead of
      me&mdash;and if I didn't get his job when I asked for it I went somewhere
      else. I don't think I read a book except a technical one for the first
      five years. And after that, when the chain-stores started going they asked
      me back to New York&mdash;a big offer too&mdash;but it wasn't the kind I
      wanted and I threw it down. I knew just how I wanted to come back to New
      York and that's the way I came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose my morals were too edifying those years. But they were as
      good as the men I went with and I kept myself in hand. I saw men go to
      pieces with drink&mdash;and I didn't drink. I saw men go to pieces over
      women&mdash;and I kept away from that kind of woman. A man has to have
      women in his life no matter how much you talk about it&mdash;but I took
      the kind with the price-tag because when you paid them you were through. I
      could have married a dozen times if I'd wanted but I didn't want&mdash;that
      old hocus-pocus of tradition was still with me, stronger than death&mdash;I
      thought I knew the kind of wife I wanted and she was in the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the partnership with Jessup came and I took it. And after a year I
      was made. I wasn't the last of one of the penniless old families that give
      each other dinners once a month and pretend they're the real society
      because they haven't money enough to trail in the present society game&mdash;even
      by then I was&mdash;what did that last newspaper story say? 'a figure of
      nation-wide importance.' Then it must be just about time, I thought, that
      this figure of nation-wide importance began to look around a little and
      married the wife he'd been waiting for and started to pick up all the
      things he hadn't had for twelve years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;Mary. And I was so careful about Mary,&rdquo; his lips twisted, half
      whimsically, half painfully. &ldquo;I was so damn sure. I was so damn sure I
      knew everything about women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had the qualities I'd said to myself I wanted&mdash;beauty, position,
      breeding, a good enough mind, some common sense. She hadn't money, but
      there I thought I could help her&mdash;the way she ran things for her
      father on what they had showed what she could do with more. We weren't in
      love with each other&mdash;oh dear no&mdash;but that I considered on the
      whole an advantage&mdash;she attracted me and it's fair enough to say that
      beside most of the men she'd been seeing my combination of having been Old
      New York and being one of the young big coming men from the West dazzled
      her rather. And anyhow I didn't want&mdash;passion&mdash;exactly. I
      thought it would take too much time when I was only in the middle of my
      game and getting as much real solid fun out of it as a kid gets out of
      cooking his own dinner in camp. I wanted a partner and a home and children
      and somebody to sit at the head of my table when I wanted to be&mdash;public&mdash;and
      yet somebody you could be at home with when you wanted to be at home. And
      I thought I had them all in Mary&mdash;I thought I was being about the
      most sensible man in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, up till after both children were born I think I tried pretty hard.
      I gave her all I could think of&mdash;materially at least. And then I
      found out in spite of myself that you can't be married to a woman&mdash;even
      bearably&mdash;and neither be lovers nor friends with her. And Mary and I
      never got beyond the social acquaintance stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't all Mary's fault either&mdash;I can see that now. A good deal
      was in the way she'd been brought up&mdash;they weren't modern about the
      blisses of ignorance in the nineties. But the rest of it was Mary and she
      couldn't have changed it any more than she could have been rude to a
      servant or raised her voice more than usual when she really wanted
      something done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'd been brought up never to be demonstrative&mdash;that was one thing.
      But that wasn't the main trouble&mdash;the main trouble was her most
      curious, most frigid self-sufficiency. Until her children came she was the
      most wholly self-sufficient person I've ever known. She was really only
      happy when she was entirely alone, always. It wasn't egotism exactly&mdash;she's
      always had a very-well-mannered conviction of her own relative
      unimportance&mdash;it was just that in spite of the fact that she seemed
      so perfectly healthy and calm and composed whenever she was with other
      people they'd be sure to hurt her a little somehow or other without
      meaning to&mdash;the only person she could genuinely depend on never to
      hurt her was herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for men, she'd formed one crystallized opinion of men in the first
      weeks of our marriage and she's kept it ever since. She looks at them as
      if they were a kind of tame wolf about the house&mdash;something you must
      never show you're afraid of, something you must feed and look after and be
      publicly amiable to because you must be just&mdash;but something you never
      never would bring in the house of your own accord or touch without feeling
      that you, that you had to preserve so jealously against all the things
      that could possibly hurt it, start to shrink and be pained inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the children came&mdash;she did and does love them. She lives for
      them. But they're part of herself too, you see, an essential part, and as
      she can't give herself to anybody but herself, she can't give them to me
      even in the easiest kind of partnership, really. You don't leave small
      children alone with even the tamest kind of wolf&mdash;and she's the kind
      of woman whose children are always six to her. And she's their mother&mdash;and
      so she has her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way it got worse. Right up to six years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd done my job&mdash;I was President of the Commercial. And I'd made my
      money, and the money still kept coming in as if it didn't make any
      difference what I did with it. I'd won my game. And what was there in it
      for me?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't have a home&mdash;I had a place where I ate and slept. I didn't
      have a wife&mdash;I had an acquaintance who kept house for me. I had
      children&mdash;at school and college. I didn't have real hobbies&mdash;I
      hadn't had time for them. And I was forty-nine. All I could do was go on
      making money till I died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you changed that,&rdquo; his voice shook a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came and I saw and knew and took you. And I'm not sorry. Because
      you've made me alive again. And I'm going to be alive now till I die.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny&mdash;I was never so anxious about anything happening as I have
      been about&mdash;our approaching mutual disappearance. Especially the last
      six months when I've been planning. But now that's settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary will have more than enough and the children are grown. They won't
      know&mdash;I still have brains enough to settle that and money will do
      nearly everything. It'll be a nine days' wonder. 'Sudden Disappearance of
      Prominent Financier&mdash;Foul Play Suspected' and that'll be all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for the Commercial&mdash;I haven't come to my age without finding out
      that nobody in the world is indispensable. If a taxi ran over me tomorrow
      they'd have to do without me&mdash;and Harris and the young men can handle
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know where there'll be an elderly gentleman retired from business
      with a country house and a garden he can putter around in all his worst
      clothes. And a wife that reads Dickens to him in the evening&mdash;oh yes,
      Rose, we'll take Dickens along. And he'll be pretty contented as things go&mdash;that
      retired old gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The darkness had passed from his eyes&mdash;he was smiling now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be nice&mdash;eh Rose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand&mdash;the warm touch was still strong, still reassuring.
      Only the eyes that he was not looking at now seemed singularly unsure, as
      if they had seen something they had pondered over lightly, as a mere
      possibility, years ago, take on sudden impatient body and demand to be
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She let her hand lie lightly in his for a moment. Then she rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half past twelve&rdquo; she said a little stiffly. &ldquo;Time for two such genuine
      antiques as we are to think of being put away in our cases for the night.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was three in the afternoon before Oliver walked into the Hotel Rosario
      again and when he did it was with the feeling that the house detective
      might come up at any moment, touch him quietly on the shoulder and remark
      that his bag <i>might</i> be sent down to the station after him if he paid
      his bill and left quietly and at once. An appearance before a hoarse judge
      who fined him ten dollars in as many seconds had not helped his
      self-confidence though he kept wondering if there was a sliding scale of
      penalties for improper language applied to the police of St. Louis and
      just what would have happened if he had called the large blue policeman
      anything out of his A.E.F. vocabulary. Also the desk, when he called there
      for his key, reminded him twingingly of the dock, and the clerk behind it
      looked at him so knowingly as he made the request that Oliver began to
      construct a hasty moral defence of his whole life from the time he had
      stolen sugar at eight, when he was reassured by the clerk's merely saying
      in a voice like a wink. &ldquo;Telephone call for you last night, Mr. Crowe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Nancy!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      With a horrible effort to keep impassive, &ldquo;Yes? Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Party didn't leave a name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bout 'leven o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she didn't leave any message?&rdquo; Then Oliver turned pink at having
      betrayed himself so easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o&mdash;<i>she</i> didn't.&rdquo; The clerk's eyelid drooped a trifle. Those
      collegy looking boys were certainly hell with women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well&mdash;&rdquo; with a vast attempt to seem careless. &ldquo;Thanks. Where's
      the 'phone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there&rdquo; and Oliver followed the direction of the jerked thumb to shut
      himself up in a booth with his heart, apparently, bent upon doing queer
      interpretative dances and his mind full of all the most apologetic words
      in or out of the dictionary. &ldquo;Hello. Hello. <i>Is this Nancy</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mrs. S. R. Ellicott.&rdquo; The voice seems extremely detached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good morning, Mrs. Ellicott. This is Oliver&mdash;Oliver Crowe, you
      know. Is Nancy there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor does it appear inclined toward lengthy conversation&mdash;the voice at
      the other end. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when will she be in? I've got to take the five o'clock train Mrs.
      Ellicott&mdash;I've simply got to&mdash;I may lose my job if I don't&mdash;but
      I've got to talk to her first&mdash;I've got to explain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be very little good, I think, in your talking to her Mr. Crowe.
      She has told me that you both consider the engagement at an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's impossible, Mrs. Ellicott&mdash;that's too absurd&rdquo; Oliver felt
      too much as if he were fighting for life against something invisible to be
      careful about his words. &ldquo;I know we quarrelled last night&mdash;but it was
      all my fault, I didn't mean anything&mdash;I was going to call her up the
      first thing this morning but you see, they wouldn't let me out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he stopped with a grim realization of just what it was that he had
      said. There was a long fateful pause from the other end of the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I don't quite understand, Mr. Crowe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wouldn't let me out. I was&mdash;er&mdash;detained&mdash;ah&mdash;kept
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Detained?&rdquo; The inflection is politely inquisitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, detained. You see&mdash;I&mdash;you&mdash;oh dammit, I was in jail.&rdquo;
       This time the pause that follows had to Oliver much of the quality of that
      little deadly hush that will silence all earth and sky in the moment
      before Last Judgment. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>In jail</i>,&rdquo; said the voice with an accent of utter finality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;oh it wasn't anything&mdash;I could explain in five
      seconds if I saw her&mdash;it was all a misunderstanding&mdash;I called
      the policeman a boob but I didn't mean it&mdash;I don't see yet why he
      took offence&mdash;it was just&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was stifling inside the airless booth&mdash;he trickled all over. This
      was worse than being court-martialled. And still the voice did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you understand?&rdquo; he yelled at last with more strength of lung than
      politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite understand, Mr. Crowe. You were in jail. No doubt we shall read
      all about it in tomorrow's papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No you won't&mdash;I gave somebody else's name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; Mrs. Ellicott was ticking off the data gathered so far on her
      fingers. The brutal quarrel with Nancy. The rush to the nearest
      blind-tiger. The debauch. The insult to Law. The drunken struggle. The
      prison. The alias. And now the attempt to pretend that nothing had
      happened&mdash;when the criminal in question was doubtless swigging from a
      pocket-flask at this very moment for the courage to support his flagrant
      impudence in trying to see Nancy again. All this passed through Mrs.
      Ellicott's mind like a series of colored pictures in a Prohibition <i>brochure</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can explain that too. I can explain everything. Please, Mrs.
      Ellicott&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Crowe, this conversation has become a very painful one. Would it not
      be wiser to close it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver felt as if Mrs. Ellicott had told him to open his bag and when he
      did so had pointed sternly at a complete set of burglar's tools on top of
      his dress-shirts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can-I-see-Nancy?&rdquo; he ended desperately, the words all run together:
    </p>
    <p>
      But the voice that answered was very firm with rectitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy has not the slightest desire to see you, Mr. Crowe. Now or ever.&rdquo;
       Mrs. Ellicott asked pardon inwardly for the lie with a false humility&mdash;if
      Nancy will not save herself from this young man whom she has always
      disliked and who has just admitted to being a jailbird in fact and a
      drunkard by implication, she will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you would find it easier hearing this from me than you
      would from her. She has found it easier to say.&rdquo; &ldquo;But, Mrs. Ellicott&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are things that take a little too much explaining to explain, Mr.
      Crowe.&rdquo; The meaning seemed vague but the tone was doomlike enough. &ldquo;And in
      any case&rdquo; the voice ended with a note of flat triumph, &ldquo;Nancy will not be
      home until dinnertime so you could not possibly telephone her before the
      departure of your train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Mr. Crowe,&rdquo; and a click at the other end showed that Mrs.
      Ellicott had hung up the receiver, leaving him to shriek &ldquo;But listen&mdash;&rdquo;
       pitiably into the little black mouthpiece in front of him until Central
      cut in on him angrily with &ldquo;Say, whatcha tryin' to do, fella? Break my
      ear?&rdquo;

      XXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      After cindery hours in a day coach&mdash;the fine and the loss of his
      Pullman reservation have left him with less than three dollars in cash&mdash;Oliver
      crawls into Vanamee and Company's about four in the afternoon. Everybody
      but Mrs. Wimple and Mr. Tickler is out of Copy for the moment and the
      former greets him with coy wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been taking your vacation at Newport, Crowie? Or didja sneak the Frisco
      account away from Brugger's Service when you were out West?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, got jugged&mdash;that was all,&rdquo; says Oliver quite truthfully if
      tiredly and Mrs. Wimple crows at the jest with high laughter. Oliver
      marvels at the fact that everybody should seem to think it so humorous to
      be jailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Crowie, you naughty little boy! Oh mischief, mischief!&rdquo; and she
      scrapes one index finger over the other at him in a try for errant
      childishness. Then she and her perfume come closer and this time she looks
      around before she speaks and there is some little real concern in her
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Crowie&mdash;you better watch your step, boy&mdash;I'm telling
      you straight. Old Man Alley was real sore when you didn't blow in
      yesterday&mdash;it was one of Vanamee's bad days when his eye gets twitchy
      and he was rearing around cursing everybody out and giving an oration on
      office discipline that'd a made a goat go laugh itself ill. And then Alley
      got hold of Délier and they are both talking about you&mdash;I know
      because Délier said 'Oh give him another chance' and Alley said 'What's
      the use, Deller&mdash;he's been here eight months and he doesn't seem to
      really get the hang of things,' in that snippy little way and then 'I
      can't stand breaches of discipline like this.' You know how nervous it
      gets him if as much as a fastener is out of place on his desk&mdash;and
      Winslow's got a kid cousin he wants to put in here and if you don't act
      like mama's darling for a while&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She is ready to go on indefinitely, but Oliver thanks her abstractedly&mdash;it
      is decent of the old girl after all&mdash;grunts &ldquo;Guess I better start in
      looking busy now, Mrs. Wimple!&rdquo; and sits down at his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A note from Deller with five pencil sketches attached of the new trade
      figures for Brittlekin&mdash;two bloated looking children with inkblot
      eyes looking greedily at an enormous bar of peanut candy. &ldquo;Dear Crowe:
      Will you give me copy on these as soon as possible&mdash;something snappy
      this time.&mdash;E. B. D.&rdquo; A memorandum, &ldquo;Mr. Piper called you 4 P.M.
      Monday. Wishes you to call him as soon as possible.&rdquo; The United Steel
      Frame Pulley layouts and another note from Deller, &ldquo;This is LATE. DO
      something.&rdquo; Back to pulleys again and the crowded sweat-box of the copy
      room and twenty-five dollars a week with the raise gone glimmering now&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Nancy is lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver sits looking at the layouts for United Steel Frame Pulleys for
      half-an-hour without really doing anything but sharpen and resharpen a
      pencil. Mrs. Wimple wonders if he's sick&mdash;he ain't white or anything
      but he looks just like Poppa did the time he came back and told Momma,
      &ldquo;Momma the bank has bust and our funds has went.&rdquo; She watches him eagerly&mdash;gee,
      it'd be exciting if he fainted or did anything queer! He said he'd been in
      jail too&mdash;Mrs. Wimple shivers&mdash;but he's so comical you never can
      tell what he really means&mdash;that way he looks may be just what she saw
      in a movie once about &ldquo;the pallid touch of the prison.&rdquo; If it's
      indigestion, though, he ought to try Pepsolax&mdash;that certainly eases
      you up right&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Oliver stacks all the layouts together in a careful pile and goes
      in to see Mr. Alley. That precise and toothy little sub-deity does not
      seem extremely enthusiastic over his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Crowe, so you got back? What detained you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Police&rdquo; says Oliver with a faint smile and Mr. Alley laughs dutifully
      enough though rather in a &ldquo;here, here, we must get down to business&rdquo; way.
      Then he fusses with his pencil a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you came in, Crowe. I wanted to see you about that matter. It is
      not so much that we begrudge&mdash;but in a place like this where everyone
      must work shoulder to shoulder&mdash;and purely as a point of office
      discipline&mdash;Mr. Vanamee is rather rigid in regard to that and your
      work so far has really hardly justified&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh that's all right, Mr. Alley&rdquo; breaks in Oliver, though not rudely, he
      is much too fagged to be rude, &ldquo;I'm leaving at the end of the week if it's
      convenient to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>really</i>, Mr. Crowe.&rdquo; But in spite of his diplomatic surprise
      he hardly seems distressfully perturbed. &ldquo;I hope it is not because you
      feel we have treated you unfairly&mdash;&rdquo; he begins again a little
      anxiously&mdash;under all his feathers of fussiness he is essentially
      kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, I'm just leaving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There are more diplomatic exchanges but when they have ended Oliver goes
      back to Copy, remarks &ldquo;Quitting Saturday, Mrs. Wimple,&rdquo; gets his hat and
      goes off a quarter of an hour earlier than he ever has before, leaving the
      rest of Copy to match pennies and opinions till closing time on the
      question as to whether he fired himself or was fired.

    <h2>
      XXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jane Ellen swayed back and forth in the porch hammock, hugging herself
      with fat arms. All her dolls lay spread out wretchedly on the floor
      beneath her, she had stripped them of every rag and they had the dejected
      appearance of victims ready for sacrifice to Baal. &ldquo;The Choolies are mad!&rdquo;
       she sang to herself, &ldquo;The Choolies are mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It had been a perfectly sensible idea to try and water the flowers on the
      parlor carpet with her doll's watering pot&mdash;those flowers hadn't had
      any water for an awful long time. But Mother had punished her in the Third
      Degree which was by hairbrush and Aunt Elsie had taken the watering-pot
      away and Rosalind and Dickie had put on such offensively virtuous
      expressions as soon as they heard her being punished that she was mad at
      them all. And not ordinarily mad&mdash;not mad just by herself&mdash;the
      Choolies were divinely incensed as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Choolies are mad!&rdquo; she hummed again like a battle-cry &ldquo;Choolies are
      dolls and all the Choolies are mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Choolies were only mad on rare occasions. It took something genuinely
      out of the ordinary to turn an inoffensive pink celluloid doll with one of
      its legs off into an angry Choolie. But when they were mad the family had
      discovered by painful experience that the only thing to do was to leave
      Jane Ellen quite entirely alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Choolies are mad, mad, mad!&rdquo; she chanted end chanted, her plump legs
      swinging, her mouth set like a prophet's calling down lightnings on
      Babylon the splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she stopped swinging. Somebody was coming up the path&mdash;any of
      the people she was mad at?&mdash;no&mdash;only Uncle Ollie. Were the
      Choolies mad at Uncle Ollie? She considered a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Jane Ellen, how goes it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small mouth was full of rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;sorry. What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Defiantly
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um <i>mad</i>. And the Choolies are mad&mdash;they're mad&mdash;they're
      mad&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver looked at her a moment but was much too wise to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They aren't mad at you, but they're mad at Motha and Aunt Elsie and Ro
      and Dickie and oh&mdash;evvabody!&rdquo; Jane Ellen stated graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as long as they aren't mad at me&mdash;Any letters for me, Jane
      Ellen?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver found them on the desk, looked them over, once, twice. A letter
      from Peter Piper. Two advertisements. A letter with a French stamp.
      Nothing from Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out on the porch again to read his letters, to the accompaniment
      of Jane Ellen's untirable chant. &ldquo;The Choolies are mad&rdquo; buzzed in his
      ears, &ldquo;The Choolies, the Choolies are mad.&rdquo; For a moment he saw the
      Choolies; they were all women like Mrs. Ellicott but they stood up in
      front of him taller than the sky and one of them had hidden Nancy away in
      her black silk pocket&mdash;put her somewhere, where he never would see
      her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ollie, you look at me sternaly&mdash;<i>don't</i> look at me so sternaly,
      Ollie&mdash;the Choolies aren't mad at you&mdash;&rdquo; said Jane Ellen
      anxiously. &ldquo;Fy do you look at me so sternaly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He grinned his best at her. &ldquo;Sorry, Jane Ellen. But my girl's chucked me
      and I've chucked my job&mdash;and consequently all <i>my</i> choolies are
      mad&mdash;&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      That night was distinguished by four uneasy meals in different localities.
      The first was Oliver's and he ate it as if he were consuming sawdust while
      the Crowes talked all around him in the suppressed voices of people
      watching a military funeral pass to its muffled drums. Mrs. Crowe was too
      wise to try and comfort him in public except by silence and even Dickie
      was still too surprised at Oliver's peevish &ldquo;Oh <i>get</i> out, kid&rdquo; when
      he tried to drag him into their usual evening boxing match to do anything
      but confide despondently to his mother that he doesn't see why Oliver has
      to act so <i>queer</i> about any girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second meal was infinitely gayer on the surface though a certain kind
      of strainedness a little like the strainedness in the pauses of a
      perfectly friendly football game when both sides are too evenly matched to
      score ran through it. Still, whatever strainedness there was could hardly
      have been Mrs. Severance's fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impeccable Elizabeth showed no surprise at being told she could have
      the day and needn't be back till breakfast tomorrow. She might have
      thought that there seemed to be a good deal of rather perishable food in
      the icebox to be wasted, if Mrs. Severance were going to have dinner out.
      But Elizabeth had always been one of the rare people who took pride in
      &ldquo;knowing when they were suited&rdquo; and the apartment on Riverside Drive had
      suited her perfectly for four years. She was also a great deal too clever
      to abstract any of those fragile viands to take to her widowed sister on
      Long Island&mdash;Mrs. Severance is so good at finding uses for all sorts
      of odd things&mdash;Elizabeth felt quite sure she would find some use or
      other for these too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted Billett certainly found a good deal of use for some of it, thought
      Mrs. Severance whimsically. It had hardly been a Paolo and Francesca <i>diner-a-deux</i>&mdash;both
      had been much too frankly hungry when they came to it and Ted's most
      romantic remarks so far had been devoted to a vivid appreciation of Mrs.
      Severance's housekeeping. But all men are very much like hungry little
      boys every so often, Mrs. Severance reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted really began to wonder around nine-thirty. At first there had been
      only coming in and finding Rose just through setting the table and then
      they had been too busy with dinner and their usual fence of talk to allow
      for any unfortunate calculations as to how Mrs. Severance could do it on
      her salary. But what a perfect little apartment&mdash;and even supposing
      all the furniture and so forth were family inheritances, and they fitted
      each other much too smoothly for that, the mere upkeep of the place must
      run a good deal beyond any &ldquo;Mode&rdquo; salary. Mr. Severance? Ted wasn't sure.
      Oh, well he was too comfortable at the moment to look gift horses of any
      description too sternly in the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose <i>was</i> beautiful&mdash;it was Ted and Rose by now. He would like
      to see someone paint her sometime as Summer, drowsy and golden, passing
      through fields of August, holding close to her rich warm body the tall
      sheaves of her fruitful corn. And again the firelight crept close to him,
      and under its touch all his senses stirred like leaves in light wind, glad
      to be hurt with firelight and then left soothed and heavy and warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only now he had a charm against what the firelight meant&mdash;what it had
      been meaning more and more these last few weeks with Rose Severance. It
      was not a very powerful-looking charm&mdash;a dozen lines of a letter from
      Elinor Piper asking him to come to Southampton, but it began &ldquo;Dear Ted&rdquo;
       and ended &ldquo;Elinor&rdquo; and he thought it would serve.
    </p>
    <p>
      That ought to be enough&mdash;that small thing only magical from what you
      made it mean against what it really was&mdash;that wish that nobody could
      even nickname hope&mdash;to keep you cool against the waves of firelight
      that rose over you like the scent of a harvest meadow. It was, almost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had been telling him how unhappy she was all evening. Not whiningly&mdash;and
      not, as he remembered later, with any specific details&mdash;but in a way
      that made him feel as if he, as part of the world that had hurt her, were
      partly responsible. And to want exceedingly to help. And then the only way
      he could think of helping was to put himself like kindling into the
      firelight, and he mustn't do that. &ldquo;Elinor&rdquo; he said under his breath like
      an exorcism, but Rose was very breathing and good to look at and in the
      next chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fingers took a long time getting his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've <i>got</i> to go Rose, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you? What's the time&mdash;eleven?&mdash;why heavens, I've kept you
      here ages, haven't I, and done nothing but moan about my troubles all the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I liked it.&rdquo; Ted's voice was curiously boyishly honest in a way
      he hated but a way that was one of Rose's reasons why he was here with
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come again,&rdquo; she said frankly. &ldquo;It was fun. I loved it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will&mdash;Lord
      knows I thank you enough&mdash;after 252A Madison Avenue it was simply
      perfect. And Rose&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awful damn sorry. I wish I could help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought she was going to laugh. Instead she turned perfectly grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you could, Ted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands&mdash;it seemed to Ted with a good deal of effort to do
      only that. Then they stood looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was so little between them&mdash;only a charm that nobody could say
      was even partly real&mdash;but somewhere in Ted's brain it said &ldquo;Elinor&rdquo;
       and he managed to shake hands again and get out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Severance waited several minutes, listening, a faint smile curling
      her mouth with intentness and satisfaction. No, this time he wouldn't come
      back&mdash;nor next time, maybe&mdash;but there would be other times&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she went into the pantry and started heating water for the dishes
      that she had explained reassuringly to Ted they were leaving for
      Elizabeth. There was no need at all of Elizabeth's knowing any more than
      was absolutely necessary.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Severance&mdash;the courtesy title at least is due him&mdash;seems to
      be a man with quite a number of costly possessions. At least here he is
      with another house, a dinner-table, servants, guests, another Mrs.
      Severance or somebody who seems to fill her place very adequately at the
      opposite end of the table, all as if Rose and the Riverside Drive
      apartment and reading Dickens aloud were only parts of a doll-house kept
      in one locked drawer of his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner is flawless, the guests importantly jeweled or stomached,
      depending on their sex, the other Mrs. Severance an admirable hostess&mdash;and
      yet in spite of it all, Mr. Severance does not seem to be enjoying himself
      as he should. But this may be due to a sort of minstrel give-and-take of
      dialogue that keeps going on between what he says for publication and what
      he thinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Frazee, I'll be ready to go into that loan matter with you inside a
      month,&rdquo; says his voice, and his mind &ldquo;Frazee, you slippery old burglar, it
      won't be a month before you'll be spreading the news that my disappearance
      means suicide and that the Commercial is rotten, lock, stock and barrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; in answer to a relayed query from the other Mrs. Severance.
      &ldquo;The children took the small car to go to the dance.&rdquo; &ldquo;And, Mary, if
      they'd ever been our children instead of your keeping them always yours,
      there wouldn't be that little surprise in store for you that I've
      arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cigar, Winthrop?&rdquo; &ldquo;Better take two, my friend&mdash;they won't be as good
      after Mary has charge of that end of the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it goes&mdash;until Mr. Severance has dined very well indeed. And yet
      Winthrop, chatting with Frazee, just before they go out of the door, finds
      it necessary to whisper to him for some reason&mdash;half a dozen words
      under cover of a discussion of what the Shipping Board's new move will
      mean to the mercantile marine. &ldquo;I told you so, George. See his hands? The
      old boy's failing.&rdquo;

      The fourth meal is Nancy's and it doesn't seem very happy. When it is over
      and Mr. Ellicott has rustled himself away from intrusion behind the
      evening paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody&mdash;'phoned today&mdash;did they, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear.&rdquo; The voice is not as easy as it might be, but Nancy does not
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nor does Nancy notice how hurriedly her mother's next question comes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see Mrs. Winters, darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;I saw her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're going on to New York?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;next week, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With her. And going to stay with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellicott sighs relievedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nancy will be safe now&mdash;as safe as if she were under an anesthetic.
      Mrs. Winters will take care of that. She must have a little talk with dear
      Isabella Winters. But that night Nancy is alone in her room&mdash;doing up
      her engagement ring and Oliver's letters in a wobbly package. She is not
      quite just, though, she keeps one letter&mdash;the first.

      XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Margaret Crowe, who, having just come to her seventeenth birthday in this
      present day and generation, felt it her official family duty to season the
      general conversation with an appropriate pepper of heartlessness, had
      really put it very well. She had said that while she didn't suppose one
      house party over Labor Day would more than partially rivet a broken heart,
      it honestly was a relief for everybody else to get Oliver out of the house
      for a while, and mother needn't look at her that way because she was as
      sorry as any of the rest of them for poor old Oliver but when people went
      about like walking cadavers and nearly bit you any time you mentioned
      anything that had to do with marriage, it was time they went somewhere
      else for a while and stayed there till they got over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mrs. Crowe, though dutifully rebuking her for her flippant treatment
      of a brother's pain, agreed with the sense of her remarks, if not with the
      wording. It had taken a good deal of quiet obstinacy on the part of the
      whole family to get Oliver to accept Peter Piper's invitation&mdash;Mrs.
      Crowe, who was understanding, knew at what cost&mdash;the cost of a man
      who has lost a hand's first appearance in company with the stump
      unbandaged&mdash;but anything would be better than the mopey Oliver of the
      last two weeks and a half, and Mrs. Crowe had been taught by a good deal
      of living the aseptic powers of having to go through the motions of
      ordinary life in front of a casual audience, even when it seemed that
      those motions were no longer of any account. So Oliver took clean flannels
      and a bitter mind to Southampton on the last day of August, and, as soon
      as he got off the train, was swung into a reel of consecutive amusements
      that, fortunately, allowed him little time to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he did, it was only to wonder rather frigidly if this fellow with
      glasses who played tennis and danced and swam and watched and commented
      athletically on the Davis Cup finals, sitting between Elinor Piper and
      Juliet Bellamy whom he had taken to dances off and on ever since he had
      had his first pair of pumps, could really be he. The two people didn't
      feel in the least the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Mr. Crowes, he thought. &ldquo;Mr. Oliver Crowe&mdash;meet Mr. Oliver
      Crowe.&rdquo; &ldquo;On our right, ladies and gentlemen, we have one of the country's
      greatest curiosities&mdash;a young gentleman who insists upon going on
      existing when there is nothing at all that makes his existence useful or
      interesting or proud. A very realistic wax figure that will toddle, shoot
      a line and play almost any sort of game until you might easily believe it
      to be genuinely alive. Mr. Oliver Crowe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The house-party was to last a week, except for Ted Billett who would have
      to go back after Labor Day&mdash;and before eight hours of it were over,
      Oliver was watching Ted with grandmotherly interest, a little mordant
      jealousy, and humor, that, at times, verged toward the hysterical. Nancy&mdash;and
      especially the loss of her&mdash;had made him sensitive as a skinless man
      to the winds and vagaries of other young people in love&mdash;and while
      Ted could look at and talk with Elinor Piper and think himself as safe as
      a turtle under its shell from the observations and discoveries of the rest
      of the party he could no more hide himself or his intentions from Oliver's
      painful scrutiny than he could have hidden the fact that he had suddenly
      turned bright green. So Oliver, a little with the sense of his own extreme
      generosity, but sincerely enough in the main, began to play kind shepherd,
      confidante, referee and second-between-the-rounds to Ted's as yet quite
      unexpressed strivings&mdash;and since most of him was only too willing to
      busy itself with anything but reminiscences of Nancy, he began to
      congratulate himself shortly that under his entirely unacknowledged
      guidance things really seemed to be getting along very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here too his streak of ineradicable humor&mdash;that bright plaything
      made out of knives that is so fine to juggle with light-handedly until the
      hand meets it in its descent a fraction of a second too soon&mdash;came
      often and singularly to his aid. He could see himself in a property white
      beard stretching feeble hands in blessing over a kneeling and respectful
      Elinor and Ted. &ldquo;Bless you my dear, dear children&mdash;for though my own
      happiness has gone with yester-year, at least I have made you&mdash;find
      each other&mdash;and perhaps, when you sit at evening among the happy
      shouts of your posterity&mdash;&rdquo; but here Oliver broke off into a snort of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Ted had confided nothing formally as yet&mdash;but then, thought
      Oliver sourly out of his own experience, he wouldn't; that was the way you
      always felt; and Ted had never been a person of easy confidences. The most
      he had done had been to take Oliver grimly aside from the dance they had
      gone to last night and explain in one ferocious and muffled sentence
      delivered half at Oliver and half at a large tree that if Hinky Selvage
      didn't stop dancing with Elinor that way he, Ted, would carry him
      unobtrusively behind a bush and force him to swallow most of his own front
      teeth. And again Oliver, looking back as a man might to the feverish
      details of a major operation, realized with cynic mirth that that was a
      very favorable symptom indeed. Oh everything was going along simply finely
      for Ted, if the poor fool only knew it. But that he would no more believe
      of course than you would a dentist who told you he wasn't going to hurt.
      People in love <i>were</i> poor fools&mdash;damn fools&mdash;unutterably
      lucky, unutterably perfect&mdash;fools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted and Oliver must have one talk though before it all happened beyond
      redemption and Ted started wearing that beautiful anesthetized smile and
      began to concoct small kindly fatal conspiracies with Elinor and Oliver
      and some nice girl. They hadn't had a real chance to talk since Oliver
      came back from St. Louis, and shortly&mdash;oh very shortly indeed by the
      way things looked&mdash;the only thing they would be able to talk about
      would be Elinor and how wonderful she and requited love and young happy
      marriage were&mdash;and however glad Oliver might be for Ted and his luck&mdash;he
      really wouldn't be able to stand that, under the present circumstances,
      for very long at a time. Ted would be gone into fortune&mdash;into a
      fortune that Oliver would have to be the last person on earth to grudge
      him&mdash;but that meant the end of eight years of fighting mockery and
      friendship together as surely as if those years were marbles and Elinor
      were dropping them down a well. They could pick it up later&mdash;after
      Ted had been married a year say&mdash;but it would have changed then, it
      wouldn't be the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver smiled rather wryly. He wondered if that was at all like what Ted
      might have thought when he and Nancy&mdash;But that wasn't comparable in
      the least. But Nancy and he were different. <i>Nancy</i>&mdash;and with
      that, the pain came so dazzlingly for a minute that Oliver had to shut his
      eyes to bear it&mdash;and something that wasn't just stupidly rude had to
      be said to Juliet Bellamy in answer to her loud clear question as to
      whether he was falling asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      All up to and through Labor Day Oliver bluffed and manoeuvered like the
      head of a small but vicious Balkan State in an International Congress for
      Ted and Elinor, and towards tea-time, decided sardonically that it was
      quite time his adopted infants took any further responsibilities off his
      shoulders. There was no use delaying conclusions any longer&mdash;Oliver
      felt as he looked at his victims like a workmanlike god who simply must
      finish the rough draft of the particular world he is fussing with before
      sunset, in spite of all rebellious or slipshod qualities in its clay.
      There would be a dance that evening. There would be, Oliver thought with
      some proprietary pride, a large sentimental moon. A few craftily casual
      words with Elinor before dinner&mdash;a real talk with Ted in one of the
      intermissions of the dance&mdash;a watchdog efficiency in guarding the two
      from intrusion while they got the business over with neatly in any one of
      several very suitable spots that Oliver had picked out already in his
      mind's eye. And then, having thoroughly settled Ted for the rest of his
      years in such a solid and satisfactory way&mdash;perhaps the queer gods
      that had everyone in charge, in spite of their fatal leaning toward
      practical-joking where the literary were concerned, might find enough
      applause in their little tin hearts for Oliver's acquired and vicarious
      merit to give him in some strange and painful way another chance to be
      alive again and not merely the present wandering spectre-of-body that
      people who knew nothing about it seemed to take so unreasonably for Oliver
      Crowe.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he laid his snares, feeling quite like Nimrod the mighty, though
      outwardly he was only kneeling on the Piper porch, waiting for the dice to
      come around to him in a vociferous game of crap that Juliet had organized&mdash;he
      seldom shot without winning now he noticed with superstitious awe. And tea
      passed to a sound of muffled crumpets, and everyone went up to dress for
      dinner.

    <h2>
      XXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Winters' little apartment on West 79th Street&mdash;she heads letters
      from it playfully &ldquo;The Hen Coop&rdquo; for there is almost always some member of
      her own sex doing time with the generous Mrs. Winters. Mrs. Winters is
      quite celebrated in St. Louis for her personally-conducted tours of New
      York with stout Middle-Western matrons or spectacled school girls east for
      visits and clothes&mdash;Mrs. Winters has the perfectly-varnished manners,
      the lust for retailing unimportant statistics and the supercilious fixed
      smile of a professional guide. Mrs. Winters' little apartment, that all
      the friends who come to her to be fed and bedded and patronized tell her
      is so charmingly New Yorky because of her dear little kitchenette with the
      asthmatic gas-plates, the imitation English plate-rail around the
      dining-room wall, the bookcase with real books&mdash;a countable number of
      them&mdash;and on top of it the genuine signed photograph of Caruso for
      which Mrs. Winters paid the sum she always makes you guess about, at a
      charity-bazaar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Winters herself&mdash;the Mrs. Winters who is <i>so</i> interested in
      young people as long as they will do exactly what she wants them to&mdash;every
      inch of her from her waved white hair to the black jet spangles on her
      dinner gown or the notes of her &ldquo;cultivated&rdquo; voice as frosted and glittery
      and artificial as a piece of <i>glacé</i> fruit. And with her, Nancy,
      dressed for dinner too, because Mrs. Winters feels it to be one's duty to
      oneself to dress for dinner always, no matter how much one's guests may
      wish to relax&mdash;Nancy as much out of place in the apartment whose very
      cushions seem to smell of that modern old-maidishness that takes itself
      for superior feminist virtue as a crocus would be in an exhibition of wool
      flowers&mdash;a Nancy who doesn't talk much and has faint blue stains
      under her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So everything went very satisfactorily indeed today, dear Nancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Winters' voice implies the uselessness of the question. Nancy is
      staying with Mrs. Winters&mdash;it would be very strange indeed if even
      the least important accompaniments of such a visit were not of the most
      satisfactory kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Winters. Nothing particularly happened, that is&mdash;but they
      like my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Winters croons at her, she is being motherly. The effect
      produced is rather that of a sudden assumption of life and vicarious
      motherhood on the part of a small, brightly-painted porcelain hen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they will be sending you over shortly, no doubt? Across the wide
      wide sea&mdash;&rdquo; adds Mrs. Winters archly, but Nancy is too tired-looking
      to respond to the fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose they will when they get ready,&rdquo; she answers briefly and returns
      to her chicken-croquette with the thought that in its sleekness,
      genteelness, crumblingness, and generally unnourishing qualities it is
      really rather like Mrs. Winters. An immense desire, after two weeks of
      Mrs. Winters' mental and physical cuisine for something as hearty and
      gross as the mere sight of a double planked steak possesses her achingly&mdash;but
      Mrs. Winters was told once that she &ldquo;ate like a bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, in that case, dear Nancy, you certainly must not leave New York
      indefinitely without making the most of your opportunities,&rdquo; Mrs. Winters'
      tones are full of genteel decision. &ldquo;I have made out a little list, dear
      Nancy, of some things which I thought, in my funny old way, might possibly
      be worth your while. We will talk it over after dinner, if you like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you so much, dear Mrs. Winters&rdquo; says Nancy with dutiful
      hopelessness. She is only too well acquainted with Mrs. Winters' little
      lists. &ldquo;As an <i>artist</i>, as an <i>artist</i>, dear Nancy, especially.&rdquo;
       Mrs. Winters breathes somewhat heavily, &ldquo;Things That Should Interest you.
      Nothing Bizarre, you understand, Nothing Merely Freakish&mdash;but some of
      the Things in New York that I, Personally, have found Worth While.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Things that Mrs. Winters Has Found Personally Worth While include a
      great many public monuments. She will give Nancy a similar list of Things
      Worth While in Paris, too, before Nancy sails&mdash;and Nancy smiles
      acceptably as each one of them is mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Mrs. Winters cannot see what Nancy is thinking&mdash;for if she did
      she might become startlingly human at once as even the most perfectly
      poised of spinsters is apt to do when she finds a rat in the middle of her
      neat white bed. For Nancy is thinking quite freely of various quaint and
      everlasting places of torment that might very well be devised for Mrs.
      Winters&mdash;and of the naked fact that once arrived in Paris it will
      matter very little to anybody what becomes of her and least of all to
      herself&mdash;and that Mrs. Winters doesn't know that she saw a chance
      mention of Mr. Oliver Crowe, the author of &ldquo;Dancer's Holiday&rdquo; today in the
      &ldquo;Bookman&rdquo; and that she cut it out because it had Oliver's name in it and
      that it is now in the smallest pocket of her bag with his creased and
      recreased first letter and the lucky piece she had from her nicest uncle
      and a little dim photograph of Mr. Ellicott and half a dozen other small
      precious things.

    <h2>
      XXX
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dance is at the Piper's this time&mdash;the last Piper dance of the
      Southampton season and the biggest&mdash;other people may give dances
      after it but everybody who knows will only think of them as relatively
      pleasant or useless addenda. The last Piper Dance has been the official
      period to the Southampton summer ever since Elinor's <i>début</i>&mdash;and
      this time the period is sure to be bigger and rounder than ever since it
      closes the most successful season Southampton has ever had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing very original about its being a masquerade, from Mr. Piper a
      courteously grey-haired mandarin in jade-green robes beside Mrs. Piper&mdash;lovely
      Mary Embree that was&mdash;in the silks of a Chinese empress, heavy and
      shining and crusted as the wings of a jeweler's butterfly, her reticent
      eyes watching the bright broken patterns of the dancing as impassively as
      if she were viewing men being tortured or invested with honor from the
      Dragon Throne, to Oliver, a diffident Pierrot who has discovered no even
      bearably comfortable way of combining spectacles and a mask, and Peter who
      [Illustration: THE LAST PIPER DANCE HAS BEEN THE OFFICIAL PERIOD TO THE
      SOUTHAMPTON SUMMER] is gradually turning purple under the furs of a
      dancing bear. Nothing much out of the ordinary in the tunes and the three
      orchestras and the fact that a dozen gentlemen dressed as the Devil are
      finding their tails very inconvenient as regards the shimmy and a dozen
      Joans of Arc are eying each other with looks of dumb hatred whenever they
      pass. Nothing singular about the light-heart throb of the music, the smell
      of powder and scent and heat and flowers, the whole loose drifting garland
      of the dancers, blowing over and around the floor in the idle designs of
      sand, floating like scraps of colored paper through a smooth wind heavy
      with music as the hours run away like light water through the fingers. But
      outside the house the Italian gardens are open, little lanterns spot them
      like elf-lights, shining on hedge-green, pale marble; the night is pallid
      with near and crowded stars, the air warm as Summer water, sweet as dear
      youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unmasking is to take place at midnight and it is past eleven when
      Oliver drops back into the stag line after being stuck for a dance and a
      half with a leaden-footed human flower-basket who devoted the entire time
      to nervous giggles and the single coy statement that she just knew he
      never could guess who she was but she recognized him perfectly. He starts
      looking around for Ted. There he is, scanning the clown's parade with the
      eyes of an anxious hawk, disgruntled nervousness plain in every line of
      his body. Then Oliver remembers that he saw a slim Chinese girl in loose
      blue silks go off the floor ten minutes or so ago with a tall musketeer.
      He goes over and touches Ted on a particolored arm&mdash;the latter is
      dressed as a red and gilt harlequin&mdash;and feels the muscles he touches
      twitch under his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cigarette? It's getting hotter than cotton in here&mdash;they'll have to
      open more windows&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Then recognizing voice and glasses &ldquo;Oh yeah&mdash;guess so&mdash;awful
      mob, isn't it?&rdquo; and they thread their way out into the cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      They wander down from the porch and into the gardens, past benches where
      the talk that is going on seems to be chiefly in throaty undertones and
      halts nervously as their steps crunch past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beautiful and damned!&rdquo; says Oliver amusedly, then a little louder <i>&ldquo;Amusez
      vous bien, mes enfants</i>&rdquo; at a small and carefully modulated shriek that
      comes from the other side of the low hedge, &ldquo;The night's still young. But
      Good Lord, isn't there <i>any</i> place in the whole works where two
      respectable people can sit without feeling like chaperones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They find one finally&mdash;it is at the far end of the gardens&mdash;a
      seat the only reason for whose obvious desertion seems to be, comments
      Oliver, that some untactful person has strung a dim but still visible
      lantern directly above it&mdash;and relapses upon it silently. It is not
      until the first cigarettes of both are little red dying stars on the grass
      beside them that either really starts to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; says Oliver, stretching his arms. The night lies over them light
      as spray&mdash;a great swimming bath and quietness of soft black, hushed
      silver&mdash;above them the whole radiant helmet of heaven is white with
      its stars. From the house they have left, glowing yellow in all its
      windows, unreal against the night as if it were only a huge flat toy made
      out of paper with a candle burning behind it, comes music, blurred but
      insistent, faint as if heard over water, dull and throbbing like
      horse-hoofs muffled with leather treading a lonely road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um. Good party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Real Piper party, Ted. And, speaking of Pipers, friend Peter certainly
      seems to be enjoying himself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Third bench on the left as we came down. Never go to a costume-party
      dressed as a dancing-bear if you want to get any quiet work in on the
      side. Rule One of Crowe's Social Code for Our Own First Families.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted chuckles uneasily and there is silence for another while as they
      smoke. Both are in very real need of talking to each other but must feel
      their way a little carefully because they are friends. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; says Ted and&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; says Oliver, simultaneously. Both laugh and the little tension that
      has grown up between them snaps at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you know that Nancy's and my engagement went bust about three
      weeks ago,&rdquo; begins Oliver with elaborate calm, his eyes fixed on his
      shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted clears his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't <i>know</i>. Afraid it was something like that though&mdash;way
      you were looking,&rdquo; he says, putting his words one after the other, as
      slowly as if he were building with children's blocks. &ldquo;What was it? Don't
      tell me unless you want to, of course&mdash;<i>you</i> know&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to, rather.&rdquo; Ted knows that he is smiling, and how, though he is not
      looking at his face. &ldquo;After all&mdash;old friends, all that. My dear old
      College chum,&rdquo; but the mockery breaks down. &ldquo;My fault, I guess,&rdquo; he says
      in a voice like metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, Ted. Acted like a fool. And then, this waiting business&mdash;not
      much use going over that, now. But it's broken. Got my&mdash;property&mdash;such
      as it was all back in a neat little parcel two weeks ago. That's why I
      quit friend Vanamee&mdash;you ought to have known from that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did, I suppose, only I hoped it wasn't. I'm damn sorry, Ollie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Ted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shake hands, but not theatrically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well&mdash;oh hell&mdash;oh dammit, you know how blasted sorry I am.
      That's all I can say, I guess&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so am I. And it was my fault, chiefly. And that's all I can say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, though.&rdquo; Ted's voice is doing its best to be logical in spite
      of the fact that two things, the fact that he is unutterably sorry for
      Oliver and the fact that he mustn't show it in silly ways, are fighting in
      him like wrestlers. &ldquo;Are you sure it's as bad as all that? I mean girls&mdash;-&rdquo;
       Ted flounders hopelessly between his eagerness to help and his knowledge
      that it will take ungodly tact. &ldquo;I mean, Nancy's different all right&mdash;but
      they change their minds&mdash;and they come around&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver spreads out his hands. It is somehow queerly comforting not to let
      himself be comforted in any degree. &ldquo;What's the use? Tried to explain&mdash;got
      her mother&mdash;Nancy was out but she certainly left a message&mdash;easier
      if we never saw each other again&mdash;well&mdash;Then she sent back
      everything&mdash;she knew I'd tried to phone her&mdash;tried to explain&mdash;never
      a word since then except my name and address on the package&mdash;oh it's
      over, Ted. Feenee. But it's pretty well smashed me. For the present, at
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you started it,&rdquo; Ted says stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I did, of course&mdash;gentlemanly supposition anyhow&mdash;that's why&mdash;don't
      you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say I do exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're both of us too proud, Ted. And too poor. And starting again&mdash;can't
      you&mdash;visualize&mdash;it wouldn't be the way it was&mdash;only both of
      us thinking about <i>that</i> all the time&mdash;and <i>still</i> we
      couldn't get married. I've got less right than ever, now&mdash;oh, but how
      <i>could</i> we after what we've said&mdash;&rdquo; and this time his voice has
      lost all the attitudes of youth, it is singularly older and seems to come
      from the center of a place full of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could help, though, Ollie. You know,&rdquo; says Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish you could.&rdquo; Then later, &ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; &ldquo;Welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both smoke and are silent for a time, remembering small things out of the
      last eight years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are you going to do, Ollie, now you've kissed the great god
      Advertising a fond good-by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ollie stirs uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno&mdash;exactly. I told you about those two short stories Easten
      wanted me to take out of my novel? Well, I've done it and sent 'em in&mdash;and
      he'll buy 'em all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's fine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a little money, anyhow. And then&mdash;remember Dick Lamoureux?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a letter from him right after&mdash;I came back from St. Louis. Well,
      he's got a big job with the American Express in Paris&mdash;European
      Advertising Manager or something like that&mdash;he's been crazy to have
      either of us come over ever since that idea of the three of us getting an
      apartment on the <i>Rive Gauche</i> fell through. Well, he says, if I can
      come over, he'll get me some sort of a job&mdash;not much to go on at
      first but they want people who are willing to stay&mdash;enough to live on
      anyway&mdash;I want to get out of the country, Ted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should think you would. Good Lord&mdash;Paris! Why you lucky, lucky
      Indian!&rdquo; says Ted affectionately. &ldquo;When'll you leave?&rdquo; &ldquo;Don't know. He
      said cable him if I really decided&mdash;think I will. They need men and I
      can get a fair enough letter from Vanamee. I've been thinking it over ever
      since the letter came&mdash;wondering if I'd take it. Think I will now.
      Well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wish I was going along, Crowe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And this time Oliver is really able to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well&mdash;but, honestly&mdash;well, no, I suppose I don't. And I
      suppose <i>that's</i> something you know all about, too, you&mdash;private
      detective!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Private detective! Why, you poor ass, if you haven't noticed how I've
      been playing godmother to you all the way through this house-party&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. I suppose I'd thank anybody else. Coming from you, though, I can
      only say that such was both my hope and my expectation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you <i>perfect</i> ass!&rdquo; Both laugh, a little unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ollie, what think?&rdquo; says Ted, finding some difficulty with his
      words for some reason or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think? Can't tell, my amorous child. Coldly considered, I think you've
      got a good show&mdash;and I'm very strong for it, needless to say&mdash;and
      if you don't go and put it over pretty soon I'll be intensely annoyed&mdash;one
      of the pleasures I've promised myself for years and years has been getting
      most disgracefully fried at your wedding, Ted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tonight is going to be zero hour, I think.&rdquo; Ted proceeds with a try
      at being flippant and Oliver cackles with mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it. I knew it. Old Uncle Ollie, the Young Proposer's Guide and
      Pocket Companion.&rdquo; Then his voice changes. &ldquo;Luck,&rdquo; he says briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'm not worthy,&rdquo; Ted begins diffidently but Oliver stops him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They never are. I wasn't. But that doesn't make any difference. You've
      got to&mdash;<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You old bum! Yes. But when I think of it&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But leaving out everything else&mdash;it seems so damned <i>cheeky!</i>
      When Elinor's got everything, including all the money in the world, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We talked that over a long time ago, remember? And remember what we
      decided&mdash;that it didn't matter, in this year and world at least. Of
      course I'm assuming that you're really in love with her&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; from Ted very soberly. &ldquo;Oh I am, all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, go ahead. And, Theodore, I shall watch your antic motions with
      the greatest sarcastic delight, both now and in the future&mdash;either
      way it breaks. Moreover I'll take anybody out of the action that you don't
      want around&mdash;and if there were anything else I could do&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got to win off my own service,&rdquo; says Ted. &ldquo;You know. But thanks all the
      same. Only when I think of&mdash;some incidents of Paris&mdash;and how
      awful near I've come to making a complete fool of myself with that
      Severance woman in the last month&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Ted.&rdquo; Oliver is really worried. &ldquo;You're not going to let that&mdash;interfere&mdash;are
      you? Right now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got to tell her.&rdquo; Ted's smile is a trifle painful. &ldquo;Got to, you
      know. Oh not that. But France. The whole business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But good heavens, man, you aren't going to make it the start of the
      conversation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;maybe not. But it's all got to be&mdash;explained. Only way
      I'll ever feel decent&mdash;and I don't suppose I'll feel too decent
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Ted&mdash;oh it's your game, of course. Only I don't think it's being&mdash;fair&mdash;to
      either of you to tell her just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help it, Ollie.&rdquo; Ted's face sets into what Oliver once christened
      his &ldquo;mule-look.&rdquo; &ldquo;I've thought it over backwards and sideways and all
      around the block&mdash;and I can't squirm out of it because it'll be
      incredibly hard to do. As a matter of fact,&rdquo; he pauses, &ldquo;it'll tell
      itself, you know, probably,&rdquo; he ends, more prophetically than he would
      probably care to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I simply <i>don't</i> see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Must</i>,&rdquo; and after that Oliver knows there is very little good of
      arguing the point much further. He has known Ted for eight years without
      finding out that a certain bitter and Calvinistic penchant for
      self-crucifixion is one of his ruling forces&mdash;and one of those least
      easily deduced from his externals. Still he makes a last effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't start getting all tied up about that. Keep your mind on
      Elinor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not&mdash;hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good&mdash;I see that you have all the proper reactions. And you'll
      excuse me for saying that <i>I</i> don't think she's too good for you&mdash;and
      even if she were she'd have to marry somebody, you know&mdash;and when you
      put it, put it straight, and let Paris and everything else you're worrying
      about go plumb to hell! And that's good advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. I'll tell you of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should <i>think</i> you would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver looks at his watch. &ldquo;Great Scott&mdash;they'll be unmasking in
      twenty minutes. And I've got to go back and cut Juliet out of the herd and
      take her to supper&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They rise and look at each other. Then
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope this is the last time, Ted, old fel&mdash;which isn't any reflection
      on the last eight years odd,&rdquo; says Oliver slowly, and their hands grip
      once and hard. Then they both start talking fast as they walk back to the
      house to cover the unworthy emotion. But just as they are going in the
      door, Oliver hisses into Ted's ear, an advisory whisper,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now go and eat all the supper you can, you idiot&mdash;it always helps.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      XXXI
    </h2>
    <p>
      The parti-colored harlequin and the young Chinese lady in blue silks are
      walking the Italian gardens, talking about nothing in particular. Ted has
      managed to discuss the moon&mdash;it is high now, a round white lustre&mdash;the
      night, which is warm&mdash;the art of garden decoration, French, English
      and Italian&mdash;the pleasantness of Southampton after New York&mdash;all
      with great nervous fluency but so completely as if he had met Elinor for
      the first time ten minutes ago that she is beginning to wonder why, if he
      dislikes her as much as that, he ever suggested leaving the dance-floor at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted, meanwhile, is frantically conscious of the fact that they have
      reached the end of the garden, are turning back, and still he is so
      cripplingly tongue-tied about the only thing he really wishes to say that
      he cannot even get the words out to suggest their sitting down. It is not
      until he stumbles over a pebble while passing a small hard marble seat set
      back in a nest of hedge that he manages to make his first useful remark of
      the promenade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;a bench!&rdquo; he says brightly, and then, because that sounded so
      completely imbecile, plunges on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you want to sit down a minute, Elinor?&mdash;I&mdash;you&mdash;it's
      so cool&mdash;so warm, I mean&mdash;&rdquo; He closes his mouth firmly&mdash;what
      a <i>ghastly</i> way to begin!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elinor says &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; politely and they try to adapt themselves to the
      backless ornamental bench, Ted nervously crossing and recrossing his legs
      until he happens to think that Elinor certainly never would marry anybody
      with St. Vitus' Dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't tell you how nice it's been this time, Elinor. And you've been&mdash;&rdquo;
       There, things are going better&mdash;at least, he has recovered his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you know how much we love to have you, Ted,&rdquo; says Elinor and Ted
      feels himself turn hot and cold as he was certain you never really did
      except in diseases. But then she adds, &ldquo;You and Ollie and Bob Templar,
      and, oh, all Peter's friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looks at her steadily for a long moment&mdash;the blue silks of her
      costume suit her completely. She is there, black hair and clear eyes,
      small hands and mouth pure as the body of a dream and elvish with thoughts
      like a pansy&mdash;all the body of her, all that people call her. And she
      is so delicately removed from him&mdash;so clean in all things where he is
      not&mdash;that he knows savagely within him that there can be no real
      justice in a world where he can even touch her lightly, and yet he must
      touch her because if he does not he will die. All the things he meant to
      say shake from him like scraps of confetti, he does not worry any more
      about money or seeming ridiculous or being worthy, all he knows at all in
      the world is his absolute need of her, a need complete as a child's and so
      choosing any words that come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen&mdash;do you like me?&rdquo; says the particolored harlequin and all the
      sharp leaves of the hedge begin to titter as wind runs over them at one of
      the oldest and least sensible questions in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Chinese lady turns toward the harlequin. There is some laughter
      in her voice and a great deal of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Ted, of course&mdash;why, why shouldn't I?&mdash;You're Peter's
      friend and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't mean <i>that</i>!&rdquo; The harlequin's hands twist at each other
      till the knuckles hurt, but he seems to have recovered most voluble if
      chaotic powers of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was silly, asking that&mdash;but it's hard&mdash;when you care for
      anybody so much you can't <i>see</i>&mdash;when you love them till they're
      the only thing there <i>is</i> you care about&mdash;and you know you're
      not fit to touch them&mdash;not worthy of them&mdash;that they're
      thousands of times too good for you but&mdash;oh, Elinor, Elinor, I just
      can't stand it any more! Do you love me, Elinor, because I love you as I
      never loved anything else in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young Chinese lady doesn't seem to be quite certain of just what is
      happening. She has started to speak three times and stopped each time
      while the harlequin has been waiting with the suspense of a man hanging
      from Heaven on a pack-thread. But then she does speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I do, Ted&mdash;-oh, Ted, I know I do,&rdquo; she says uncertainly&mdash;and
      then Oliver, if he were there, would have stepped forward to bow like an
      elegant jack-knife at the applause most righteously due him for perfect
      staging, for he really could not have managed better about the kiss that
      follows if he had spent days and days showing the principals how to
      rehearse it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then something happens that is as sudden as a bubble's going to pieces
      and most completely out of keeping with any of Oliver's ideas on how love
      should be set for the theatre. For &ldquo;Oh, what am I <i>doing</i>?&rdquo; says the
      harlequin in the voice of a man who has met his airy double alone in a
      wood full of ghosts and seen his own death in its face, and he crumples
      into a loose bag of parti-colored silks, his head in his hands.
      [Illustration: The Young Chinese Lady is Shrinking Inside Her Silks] It
      would be nothing very much to any sensible person, no doubt&mdash;the
      picture that made itself out of cold dishonorable fog in the instant of
      peace after their double release from pain. It was only the way that
      Elinor looked at him after the kiss&mdash;and remembering the last time he
      saw his own diminished little image in the open eyes of a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Chinese lady is shrinking inside her silks as if frost had
      touched her&mdash;all she knows is that she doesn't understand. And then
      there is the harlequin looking at her with his face gone suddenly pinched
      and odd as if he had started to torture himself with his own hands; and
      the fact that he will not touch her, and what he says.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Elinor, darling. Oh, I can't tell you, I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what <i>is</i> it, Ted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's this&mdash;it's what I meant to tell you before I ever told you I
      loved you&mdash;what I haven't any right not to tell you&mdash;and I guess
      that the fact I didn't, shows pretty well what sort of a fellow I am. Do
      you really think you know about me, dear&mdash;do you really think you
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, Ted.&rdquo; The voice is still a little chill with the fright
      he gave her, but under that it is beautifully secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you don't. And, oh Lord, why couldn't it have happened before I
      went to France!&mdash;because then it would have been all different and
      I'd have had some sort of a right&mdash;not a right, maybe&mdash;but
      anyhow, I could have come to you&mdash;straight. I can't now, dear, that's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice halts as if something were breaking to pieces inside of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't bring you what you'd bring me. Oh, it isn't anything&mdash;physically&mdash;dangerous&mdash;that
      way&mdash;I&mdash;was&mdash;lucky.&rdquo; The words space themselves as slowly
      as if each one of them burnt like acid as it came. &ldquo;It's&mdash;just&mdash;that.
      Just that&mdash;while I was in France&mdash;I went over&mdash;all the
      hurdles&mdash;and then a few more, I guess&mdash;and I've got to&mdash;tell
      you about it&mdash;because I love you&mdash;and because I wouldn't dare
      love you, even&mdash;if I didn't&mdash;tell you the truth. You see. But,
      oh my God, I never thought it would&mdash;hurt so!&rdquo; and the parti-colored
      body of the harlequin is shaken with a painful passion that seems
      ridiculously out of keeping with his motley. But all that the young
      Chinese lady feels is that for a single and brittle instant she and
      somebody else had a star in their hands that covered them with light clean
      silver, and that now the conjuror who made the star out of nothing and
      gave it to her is showing her just why there never was any star. Moreover,
      she has only known she was in love for the last five minutes&mdash;and
      that is hardly long enough for her to discover that love itself is too
      living to be very much like any nice girl's dreams of it&mdash;and the
      shock of what Ted has said has brought every one of her mother's reticent
      acid hints on the general uncleanliness of Man too prickling-close to her
      mind. And she can't understand&mdash;she never will understand, she thinks
      with dull pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh how <i>could</i> you, Ted? How <i>could</i> you?&rdquo; she says as he waits
      as a man walking the plank might wait for the final gentle push that will
      send him overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know it was fine of you to tell me&mdash;but it's just spoiled
      everything forever. Oh, Ted, how <i>could</i> you?&rdquo; and then she is
      half-running, half-walking, up the path toward the porch and all she knows
      is that she must get somewhere where she can be by herself. The harlequin
      does not follow her.

    <h2>
      XXXII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver, in the middle of a painfully vivid dream in which he has just
      received in the lounge of a Yale Club crowded with whispering, pointing
      spectators the news that Miss Nancy Ellicott of St. Louis has eloped with
      the Prince of Wales, wakes, to hear someone stumbling around the room in
      the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you, Ted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't&mdash;I'm there. What's time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Bout five, I guess.&rdquo; Ted doesn't seem to want to be very communicative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um.&rdquo; A pause while Oliver remembers what it was he wanted to ask Ted
      about and Ted undresses silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;congratulations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted's voice is very even, very controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, Ollie. Not even with all your good advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Honestly</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, look here&mdash;better luck next time, anyway. It's all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over, Ollie. I'm getting out of here tomorrow before most of
      them are up. Special breakfast and everything&mdash;called back to town by
      urgent legal affairs.&rdquo; He laughs, rather too barkingly for Oliver to like
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's an angel, Ollie. But I had to tell her&mdash;about France. That
      broke it. D'you wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you poor, damn, honorable, simple-minded, blessed, blasted fool! <i>Before</i>
      you'd really begun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted hesitates. &ldquo;Y-yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if all you can do is to lie back in bed there and call on your
      Redeemer when&mdash;-Sorry, Ollie. But I'm not feeling too pleasant
      tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ought to know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgot. You ought. Well&mdash;you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't see anything yet that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ollie, what's the use? We can both of us play Job's comforter to the
      other because we're pretty good friends. But you can see how my telling
      her would&mdash;oh well there isn't much percentage in hashing it over.
      I've done what I've done. If I'd known I'd have to pay for it this way, I
      wouldn't have&mdash;but there, we're all made like that. There's one thing
      I can't do&mdash;and that is get away with a thing like that on false
      pretences&mdash;I'd rather shoot the works on one roll and crap than use
      the sort of dice that behave. I went into the thing with my eyes open&mdash;now
      I've got to pay for it&mdash;well, what of it? It wouldn't make all the
      difference to a lot of girls, perhaps&mdash;a lot of the best&mdash;but it
      does to Elinor and she's the only person I want. If I can't have her, I
      don't want anything&mdash;but if I've made what all the Y.M.C.A.
      Christians that ever sold nickel bars of chocolate for a quarter would
      call a swine out of myself&mdash;well, I'm going to be a first-class
      swine. So put on my glad rags, Josie, I'm going to Rector's and hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this has been light enough toward the end but the lightness is not far
      from a very real desperation, all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning by which?&rdquo; Oliver queries uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meaning by which that some of my address for the next two-three weeks
      will be care of Mrs. Rose Severance, 4th floor, the Nineveh, Riverside
      Drive, New York&mdash;you know the place, I showed it to you once from a
      bus-top when we were talking the mysterious lady over. And that I don't
      think Mr. Theodore Billett will graduate <i>cum laude</i> from Columbia
      Law School. In fact, I think it very possible that Mr. Billett will join
      Mr. Oliver Crowe, the celebrated unpublished novelist on a pilgrimage to
      Paris for to cure their broken hearts and go to the devil like gentlemen.
      Eh, Ollie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's all right for <i>me</i>,&rdquo; says Oliver combatively. &ldquo;And I
      always imagined we'd find each other in hell. I'm not trying to be
      inhospitable with my own pet red-hot gridiron, but all the same&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Crowe, for Pete's sake, it's five o'clock in the morning and I'm
      catching the 7.12&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Oliver is too sleepy to argue the point. Besides he knows quite well
      that any arguments he can use will only drive Ted, in his present state of
      mind, a good deal farther and faster along the road he has so dramatically
      picked out for himself. So, between trying to think of some means of
      putting either sense or the fear of God into Elinor Piper, whatever Ted
      may say about it, and wondering how the latter would take a suggestion to
      come over to Melgrove for a while instead of starting an immoral existence
      with that beautiful but possessive friend of Louise's, he drops off to
      sleep.

    <h2>
      XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver had depended on Ted's noisy habits in dressing and packing to wake
      him and give them a chance to talk before Ted left&mdash;but when he woke
      it was to hear a respectful servantly voice saying &ldquo;Ten o'clock, sir!&rdquo; and
      his first look around the room showed him that Ted's bed was empty and
      Ted's things were gone. There was a scribbled note propped up against the
      mirror, though.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Dear Ollie:

  &ldquo;So long&mdash;and thanks for both good advice
  and sympathy. The latter helped if the former
  didn't. Drop me a message at 252A as soon
  as you decide on this French proposition. I'm
  serious about it.                    TED.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      By the time he had read this through, Oliver began to feel rather
      genuinely alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not believe that the whole affair between Ted and Elinor Piper
      had gone so utterly wrong as the note implied&mdash;he had had a whimsical
      superstition that it must succeed because he was playing property man to
      it after his own appearance as Romeo had failed&mdash;but he knew Ted and
      the two years' fight against the struggling nervous restlessness and
      discontent with everything that didn't have either speed or danger in it
      that the latter, like so many in his position, had had to make. His mouth
      tightened&mdash;no girl on earth, even Nancy, could realize exactly what
      that meant&mdash;the battle to recover steadiness and temperance and
      sanity in a temperament that was in spite of its poised externals most
      brilliantly sensitive, most leapingly responsive to all strong stimuli&mdash;a
      temperament moreover that the war and the armistice between them had
      turned wholly toward the stimuli of fever&mdash;and Ted had made it with
      neither bravado nor bluster and without any particular sense of doing very
      much&mdash;and now this girl was going to smash it and him together as if
      she were doing nothing more important than playing with jackstones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered a crowd of them talking over suicide one snowy night up in
      Coblenz&mdash;young talk enough but Ted had been the only one who really
      meant it&mdash;he had got quite vehement on picking up your proper cue for
      exit when you knew that your part was through or you were tired of the
      part. He remembered café hangers-on in Paris&mdash;college men&mdash;men
      who could talk or write or teach or do any one of a dozen things&mdash;but
      men who had crumbled with intention or without it under the strain of the
      war and the snatches of easy living to excess, and now had about them in
      everything they said or wore a faint air of mildew; men who stayed in
      Paris on small useless jobs while their linen and their language verged
      more and more toward the soiled second-hand&mdash;who were always meaning
      to go home but never went. If Ted went to Paris&mdash;with his present
      mind. Why Ted was his best friend, Oliver realized with a little queer
      shock in his mind&mdash;it was something they had never just happened to
      say that way. And therefore. Far be it from Oliver to be rude to the
      daughter of his hostess, but some things were going to be explained to
      Miss Elinor Piper if they had to be explained by a public spanking in the
      middle of the Jacobean front hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then there was breakfast, at which few girls appeared, and Elinor was
      not one of the few. And then Peter insisted on going for a swim before
      lunch&mdash;and then lunch with Elinor at the other end of the table and
      Juliet Bellamy talking like a mechanical piano into Oliver's ear so that
      he had to crane his neck to see Elinor at all. What he saw, however,
      reassured him a little&mdash;for he had always thought Elinor one of the
      calmest young persons in the world, and calm young persons do not
      generally keep adding spoonfuls of salt abstractedly to their clam-broth
      till the mixture tastes like the bottom of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even at that it was not till just before tea-time that Oliver managed
      to cut her away from the vociferous rest of the house-party that seemed
      bent on surrounding them both with the noise and publicity of a private
      Coney Island. Peter has expressed a fond desire to motor over to a little
      tea-room he knows where you can dance and the others had received the
      suggestion with frantic applause. Oliver was just starting downstairs
      after changing his shoes, cursing house-party manners in general and
      Juliet Bellamy in particular all over his mind when Elinor's voice came up
      to him from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really, Petey. No, I know it's rude of me but honestly I am <i>tired</i>
      and if I'm going to feel like anything but limp <i>tulle</i> this evening.
      No, I'm <i>perfectly</i> all right, I just want to rest for a little while
      and I promise I'll be positively incandescent at dinner. No, Juliet dear,
      I wouldn't keep you or anybody else away from Peter's nefarious projects
      for the world&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was quite enough for Oliver&mdash;he tiptoed back and hid in his own
      closet&mdash;wondering mildly how he was going to explain his presence
      there if a search party opened the door. He heard a chorus of voices
      calling him from below, first warningly, then impatiently&mdash;heard
      Peter bounce up the stairs and yell &ldquo;Ollie! Ollie, you slacker!&rdquo; into his
      own room&mdash;and then finally the last motor slurred away and he was
      able to creep out of his shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met Elinor on the stairs&mdash;looking encouragingly droopy, he
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Ollie, what's the matter? The pack was howling for you all over the
      house&mdash;they've all gone over to the Sharley&mdash;look, I'll get you
      a car&mdash;&rdquo; She went down a couple of steps toward the telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver immediately and without much difficulty put on his best expression
      of blight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, El&mdash;must have dropped off to sleep,&rdquo; he said unblushingly.
      &ldquo;Lay down on my bed to sort of think some things over&mdash;and that's
      what happens of course. But don't bother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no trouble. I could take you over myself but I was so sort of fagged
      out&mdash;that's why I didn't go with them,&rdquo; she added&mdash;a little
      uncertainly he noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;oh it's just being silly and tired I suppose, but all of them
      together&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Oliver and hoped his voice had sounded appropriately
      bitter. &ldquo;No reflections on you or Peter, El, you both understand and
      you've both been too nice for words&mdash;but some of the others sometimes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I'm <i>sorry</i>,&rdquo; said Elinor contritely, and Oliver felt somewhat as
      if he were swindling her out of sympathy she probably needed for herself
      by deliberately calling attention to his own cut finger. But it had to be
      done&mdash;there wasn't any sense in both of them, he and Ted, walking
      crippled when one of them might be able to doctor the other up by just
      giving up a little pride. He went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I thought&mdash;I'd just stay around here with a book or something&mdash;get
      some tea from your mother, later, if she were here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I can do that much for you, Ollie, anyway. Let's have it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look here, if you were going to do anything&mdash;&rdquo; knowing that
      after that she could hardly say so, even if she were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no. And besides, with both of us here and both of us blue it would be
      silly if we went and were melancholy at each other from opposite sides of
      the house.&rdquo; She tried to be enthusiastic. &ldquo;And there's strawberry jam and
      muffins somewhere&mdash;the kind that Peter makes himself such a pig about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Elinor, you certainly are a friend&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little later, in a quiet corner of the porch with the tea-steam floating
      pleasantly from the silver nose of its pot and a decorous scarlet and
      yellow still-life of muffins and jam between them, Oliver felt that so far
      things had slid along as well as could be expected. Elinor's manners in
      the first place and her genuine liking for him in the second had come to
      his help as he knew they would&mdash;she was too concerned now with trying
      to comfort him in small unobtrusive ways to be on her guard herself about
      her own troubles. All he had to do, he knew, was to sit there and look
      ostentatiously brokenhearted to have the conversation move in just the
      directions he wished and that, though it made him feel shameless was not
      exactly difficult&mdash;all he required was a single thought of the last
      three weeks to make his acting sour perfection itself. &ldquo;Greater love hath
      no man than this,&rdquo; he thought with a grotesque humor&mdash;he wondered if
      any of the celebrated story-book patterns of friendship from Damon and
      Jonathan on would have found things quite so easy if they had had to take
      not their lives but most of their most secret and painful inwards and put
      them down on a tea-table like a new species of currant bun under the eyes
      of a friendly acquaintance to help their real friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't tell you how awfully decent it was of you and Peter,&rdquo; he began
      finally after regarding a buttered muffin for several minutes as if it
      were part of the funeral decorations for dead young love. &ldquo;Asking me out
      here, just now. Oh I'll write you a charming bread-and-butter letter of
      course&mdash;but I wanted to tell you really&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped and let
      the sentence hang with malice aforethought. Elinor's move. Trust Elinor.
      And the trust was justified for she answered as he wanted her to, and at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Ollie, as if it was anything&mdash;when we've all of us more or less
      grown up together, haven't we&mdash;and you and Peter&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped&mdash;oh
      what was the use of being tactful! &ldquo;I suppose it sounds&mdash;put on&mdash;and&mdash;sentimental
      and all that&mdash;saying it,&rdquo; she laughed nervously, &ldquo;but we&mdash;all of
      us&mdash;Peter and myself&mdash;we're so really <i>sorry</i>&mdash;if
      you'll believe us&mdash;only it was hard to know if you wanted to have us
      say so&mdash;how awfully sorry we were. And then asking you out here with
      this howling mob doesn't seem much like it, does it? but Peter was going
      to be here&mdash;and Ted&mdash;and I knew what friends you'd been in
      college&mdash;I thought maybe&mdash;but I just didn't want you to think it
      was because we didn't care&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;thanks&mdash;and I do appreciate,
      Elinor.&rdquo; Oliver noticed with some slight terror that his own voice seemed
      to be getting a little out of control. But what she had just said took
      away his last doubt as to whether she was really the kind of person Ted
      ought to marry&mdash;and in spite of feeling as if he were trapping her
      into a surgical operation she knew nothing about, he kept on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gets pretty bad, sometimes,&rdquo; he said simply and waited. Last night&mdash;if
      things came out right later&mdash;will have been just what Elinor needed
      most, he decided privately. She had always struck him as being a little
      too aloof to be quite human&mdash;but she was changing under his eyes to a
      very human variety of worried young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, isn't there something we can really <i>do</i>?&rdquo; she said
      diffidently, then changing,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh I mean it&mdash;if you don't think it's only&mdash;probing&mdash;asking
      that?&rdquo; as she changed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing I'm afraid, Elinor, though I really do thank you.&rdquo; He hated
      his voice&mdash;it sounded so brave. &ldquo;It's just finished, that's all.
      Can't kick very well. Oh no,&rdquo; as she started to speak, &ldquo;it doesn't hurt to
      talk about, really. Helps, more. And Peter and Ted help too&mdash;especially
      Ted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He watched her narrowly&mdash;changing color like that must mean a good
      deal with Elinor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then &ldquo;Why Ted?&rdquo; she said, almost as if she were talking to herself and
      then started to try and make him see that that didn't matter&mdash;a
      spectacle to which he remained gratifiedly blind. He addressed his next
      remarks at the dish of jam so that she wouldn't be able to catch his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not slamming Peter's sympathetic soul, El, you know I'm not&mdash;but
      Ted and I just happened to go through such a lot of the war and after it
      together&mdash;and then Ted saw a good deal more of Nancy. Peter's
      delightful. And kind. But he does assume that because lots of people get
      engaged and disengaged again all over the lot these days as if they were
      cutting for bridge-partners there isn't anything particularly serious in
      things like that. Nothing to really make you make faces and bust, that is.
      Well, ours happened to be one of the other kind&mdash;that's the
      difference. And Peter, well, Peter isn't exactly the soul of constancy
      when it comes to such matters&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peter&mdash;oh Peter&mdash;if you knew the millions of girls that Peter's
      kept pictures of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've heard all about the last hundred thousand or so, I think. But
      there's perfect safety in thousands. It's when you start being so stalwart
      and sure and manly about one&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver spread out his hands. Elinor's color&mdash;the way it fluctuated at
      least&mdash;was most encouraging. So was the fact that she had tried to
      butter her last muffin with the handle of her knife. &ldquo;But I don't see <i>how</i>
      if a girl really cared about a man she could let anything&mdash;&rdquo; she said
      and then stopped with a burning flush. And now Oliver knew that he had to
      be very careful. He looked over his tools and decided that infantile
      bitterness was best.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girls are girls,&rdquo; he said shortly, stabbing a muffin. &ldquo;They tell you they
      do and then they tell you they don't&mdash;that's them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver Crowe, I never heard such a nasty, childish seventeen-year-old
      idea from you in my whole life!&rdquo; Oh what would calm Mrs. Piper say if she
      could see Elinor, eyes cloudy with anger, leaning across the tea-wagon and
      emphasizing her points by waves of a jammy knife as she defends constancy
      and romance! &ldquo;They do <i>not</i>! When a girl cares for a man&mdash;and
      she knows he cares for her&mdash;she doesn't care about <i>anything</i>
      else, she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what Nancy said,&rdquo; remarked Oliver placidly out of his muffin. &ldquo;And
      then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know I'm sorry for you&mdash;you know I'm just as sorry for you
      as I can be,&rdquo; went on Elinor excitedly. &ldquo;But all the same, my dear Ollie,
      you have no right in the least to say that just because one girl has
      broken her engagement with you, all girls are the same. I know dozens of
      girls&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; from Oliver, quietly. &ldquo;Dozens. And they're just
      the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They <i>aren't</i>. And I haven't the slightest wish to suggest that it
      was <i>your</i> fault, Oliver&mdash;but no girl as sweet and friendly and
      darling as Nancy Ellicott, the little I knew of her that is, but other
      girls can tell, and she certainly thought you were the person that made
      all the stars come out in the sky and twinkle, would go and break her
      engagement <i>entirely</i> of her own accord&mdash;you <i>must</i> have&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now Oliver looked at her with a good deal of sorrowful pity&mdash;she
      had delivered herself so completely into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never said it was her fault, Elinor,&rdquo; he said gently, keeping the
      laughter back by a superb effort of will. &ldquo;It was mine, I am sure,&rdquo; and
      then he added most sorrowfully, &ldquo;All mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Well!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he forgot that he was there playing checkers with himself and
      Elinor for Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've never been through it, have you?&rdquo; he said rather fiercely. &ldquo;You
      can't have&mdash;you couldn't talk like that if you had. When you've put
      everything you've got in mind or body or soul completely in one person's
      hands and then, just because of a silly misunderstanding we neither of us
      meant&mdash;they drop it&mdash;and you drop with it and the next thing you
      know you're nothing but a <i>mess</i> and all you can wonder is if even
      the littlest part of you will ever feel whole again&mdash;&rdquo; He realized
      that he was very nearly shouting, and then, suddenly, that if he kept on
      this way the game was over and lost. He must think about Ted, not Nancy.
      Ted, Ted. Mr. Theodore Billett, Jr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'd forgiven me such a lot,&rdquo; he ended rather lamely. &ldquo;I thought she'd
      keep on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his outburst had only made Elinor feel the sorrier for him&mdash;he
      felt like a burglar as he saw the kindness in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't imagine she ever had such an awful lot to forgive, Ollie,&rdquo; she
      said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lie he had been leading up to all the way came at last,
      magnificently hesitant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had, Elinor. I was in France you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was afraid when he had said it&mdash;it sounded so much like a title
      out of a movie&mdash;but he looked steadily at her and saw all the color
      go out of her face and then return to it burningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that wasn't anything to be&mdash;forgiven about exactly&mdash;was
      it?&rdquo; she said unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke carefully, in broken sentences, only the knowledge that this was
      the only way he could think of to help things nerving his mind. &ldquo;It wasn't
      being in France, Elinor. It was&mdash;the adjuncts. I don't suppose I was
      any worse than most of my outfit&mdash;but that didn't make it any easier
      when I had to tell her I hadn't been any better. I felt,&rdquo; his voice rose,
      his literary trick of mind had come to his rescue now and made him know
      just how he would have felt if it had really happened, &ldquo;I felt as if I
      were in hell. Really. But I had to tell her. And when she'd forgiven me
      that&mdash;and said that it was all right&mdash;that it didn't make any
      real difference now&mdash;I thought she was about the finest person in the
      world&mdash;for telling me such nice lies. And after that&mdash;I was so
      sure that it was all right&mdash;that because of her knowing and still
      being able to care&mdash;it would last&mdash;oh well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, waiting for Elinor but Elinor for a person so voluble a little
      while ago seemed curiously unwilling to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord knows why I'm telling you this&mdash;except that we started arguing
      and you're nice enough to listen. It's not tea-table conversation, or it
      wouldn't have been ten years ago&mdash;and if I've shocked you, I'm sorry.
      But after that, as I said&mdash;I didn't think there was anything that
      could separate us&mdash;really I didn't&mdash;and then just one little
      time when we didn't quite understand each other and&mdash;over. Sorry to
      spoil your illusions, Elinor, but that's the way people do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how could she?&rdquo; and this time there was nothing but pure hurt
      questioning in Elinor's voice and the words seemed to hurt her as if she
      were talking needles. &ldquo;Why Ollie&mdash;she couldn't possibly&mdash;if she
      really cared&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All he wondered was which of them would break first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She could,&rdquo; he said steadily, in spite of the fact that everything in his
      mind kept saying &ldquo;No. No. No.&rdquo; &ldquo;Any girl could&mdash;easily. Even you,
      Elinor&mdash;if you'll excuse my being rude&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he thought that his carefully plotted scenario was going to
      break up into melodrama with the reticent, composed and sympathetic
      Elinor's suddenly rising and slapping his face. Then he heard her say in a
      voice of utter anger,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say anything like that, how can you? You are being the most
      hateful person that ever lived. Why if I really cared for anyone&mdash;if
      I ever really cared&mdash;&rdquo; and then she began to cry most steadily and
      whole-heartedly into her napkin and Oliver in spite of all the generous
      plaudits he was receiving from various parts of his mind for having
      carried delicate business successfully to a most dramatic conclusion,
      wondered what in the name of Hymen his cue was now. Some remnants of
      diplomacy however kept him from doing anything particularly obtrusive and,
      after he had received an official explanation of nervous headache with
      official detachment, the end of tea found them being quite cheerful
      together. Neither alluded directly to what both thought about most but in
      spite of that each seemed inwardly convinced of being completely if
      cryptically understood by the other and when the noise of the first
      returning motor brought a friendly plotter's &ldquo;You talk to them&mdash;they
      mustn't see me this way,&rdquo; from Elinor and a casual remark from Oliver that
      he felt sure he would have to run into town for dinner&mdash;family had
      forwarded a letter from an editor this morning&mdash;so if she wanted
      anything done&mdash;they seemed to comprehend each other very thoroughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He babbled with the returning jazzers for a quarter of an hour or so,
      tactfully circumvented Peter into offering him the loan of a car since he
      had to go into New York, and intimated that he would drop back and in at
      the Rackstraws' dance as soon as possible, after many apologies for daring
      to leave at all. Then he went slowly upstairs, humming loudly as he did
      so. Elinor met him outside his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ollie&mdash;as long as you're going in&mdash;I wonder if you'd mind&mdash;&rdquo;
       Her tone was elaborately careless but her eyes were dancing as she gave
      him a letter, firmly addressed but unstamped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, glad to&mdash;&rdquo; And then he grinned. &ldquo;You'll be at the Rackstraws'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Ollie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;we'll be back by ten thirty or try to. Maybe earlier,&rdquo; he said
      at her back and she turned and smiled once at him. Then he went into his
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Theodore Billett,&rdquo; said the address on the letter, &ldquo;252A Madison
      Ave., N. Y. C.,&rdquo; and down in the lower corner, &ldquo;Kindness of Mr. Oliver
      Crowe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought he might very well ask for the latter phrase on Ted's and
      Elinor's wedding invitations. He passed a hand over his forehead&mdash;that
      had been harder than walking a tight-rope with your head in a sack&mdash;but
      the chasm had been crossed and nothing was left now but the fireworks on
      the other side. How easy it was to tinker other people's love-affairs for
      them&mdash;for oneself the difficulties were somehow a little harder to
      manage, he thought. And then he began considering how long it would take
      from Southampton to New York in the two-seater and just where Ted would
      most likely be.

    <h2>
      XXXIV
    </h2>
    <p>
      A long-distance telephone conversation about six o'clock in the afternoon
      between two voices usually so even and composed that the little pulse of
      excitement beating through both as they speak now seems perilous,
      unnatural. One is Mr. Severance's thin cool speech and the other&mdash;most
      curious, that&mdash;seems by every obsequious without being servile,
      trained and impassive turn and phrase to be that of that treasure among
      household treasures, Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My instructions were that I was to call you, sir, whenever I was next
      given an evening out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Elizabeth. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been given an evening out tonight, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Severance has told me that I am on no account to return till
      tomorrow morning, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the materials of a small but quite sufficient meal for two
      persons in the refrigerator, sir. Mrs. Severance is dining out, sir&mdash;she
      said.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes. Any further information?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Severance received a telephone call this morning, sir, before she
      went out. It was after that that she told me I was to have the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not happen to&mdash;overhear&mdash;the conversation, did you,
      Elizabeth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, sir. Mrs. Severance spoke very low. The only words that I could
      catch were 'You' at the beginning and 'Please come' near the end. The
      words 'please come' were rather&mdash;affectionately&mdash;spoken if I
      might make so bold, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have done very well, Elizabeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Should you wish me to 'phone you again before tomorrow morning,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Elizabeth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir. Good-by, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Elizabeth.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXXV
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rest of the party has scattered to the gardens or the porch&mdash;Oliver
      has wandered into the library alone to wait for Peter who is bringing
      around the two-seater himself. It is a big dim room with books all the way
      up to the ceiling and a comfortable leather lounge upon which he sinks,
      picks up a magazine from a little table beside it and starts ruffling the
      pages idly. The chirrup of a telephone bell that seems to come out of the
      wall beside him makes him jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he remembers&mdash;that must be Mr. Piper's office through the closed
      door there. He remembers, as well, Peter joking with his father once about
      his never getting away from business even in the country and pointing at
      the half dozen telephones on top of the big flat desk with a derisive
      gesture while detailing to Oliver the fondness that Sargent Piper has for
      secretive private wires and the absurd precautions he takes to keep them
      intensely private. &ldquo;Why he went and had all his special numbers here
      changed once just because I found out one of them by mistake and called
      him up on it for a joke&mdash;the cryptic old person!&rdquo; Peter had said with
      mocking affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telephone chirrups again and Oliver gets up and goes toward the door
      of the office with a vague idea of answering it since there seem to be no
      servants about. Then he remembers something else&mdash;Peter's telling him
      that nothing irritates his father more than having anyone else answer one
      of his private wires&mdash;and stops with his hand on the door that has
      swung inward an inch or so already under his casual pressure. It doesn't
      matter anyhow&mdash;there&mdash;somebody has answered it&mdash;Mr. Piper
      probably, as there is another door to the office and both of them are
      generally kept locked. Mr. Piper like all great business men has his petty
      idiosyncrasies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver is just starting to turn away when a whisper of sound that seems
      oddly like &ldquo;Mrs. Severance&rdquo; comes to his ear by some trick of acoustics
      through the door. He hesitates&mdash;and stays where he is, wondering all
      the time why he is doing anything so silly and unguest-like&mdash;and also
      what on earth he could say if Mr. Piper suddenly flung open the door. But
      Ted has told him a good deal at various times of the more mysterious
      aspects of Mrs. Severance, and her name jumping out at him this way from
      the middle of Mr. Piper's private office makes it rather hard to act like
      a copybook gentleman&mdash;especially with his last conversation with Ted
      still plain in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voices are too low for him to hear anything distinctly but again one
      of the speakers says &ldquo;Mrs. Severance&rdquo;&mdash;of that he is entirely sure.
      The receiver clicks back and Oliver regains the lounge in three long soft
      strides, thanking his carelessness that he is still wearing rubber-soled
      sport-shoes. He is very much absorbed in an article on &ldquo;Fishing for Tuna&rdquo;
       when Peter comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Oliver, everything ready for you. Awfully sorry you have to rush in
      this way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, nuisance all right, but it's my one best editor and that may mean
      something real&mdash;terribly cheeky thing for me to do, Pete&mdash;bumming
      your car like this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh rats, you know you're welcome&mdash;and anyhow I'm lending it to you
      because you'll have to bring it back, and that means you'll come back
      yourself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well look, Pete, <i>please</i> make all the excuses you can for me to
      your mother. And I'll run back here and change and then go over to the
      Rackstraws', as soon as I can&mdash;Elinor told you about Ted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Sounds sort of simple to me asking him back tonight for that beach
      picnic tomorrow when he absolutely had to leave this morning&mdash;but I
      never could keep all Elinor's social arrangements straight. Certainly hope
      he can get off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; says Oliver non-committally and then the door of Mr. Piper's
      office opens and Mr. Piper comes out looking as well-brushed and courteous
      as usual but with a face that seems as if it had been touched all over
      lightly with a grey painful stain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Father? Anything up from Secret Headquarters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, boy,&rdquo; and Oliver is surprised at the effort with which Mr. Piper
      smiles. &ldquo;Winthrop called up a few minutes ago about those Hungarian bonds
      but it wasn't anything important&mdash;&rdquo; and again Oliver is very much
      surprised indeed, though he does not show it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your mother here, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upstairs dressing, I think, Father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Piper hesitates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you might tell her&mdash;it's nothing of consequence but I must go
      in to town for a few hours&mdash;I shall have them give me a sandwich or
      so now and catch the 7.03, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look, Father, Oliver has to go in too, for dinner&mdash;he's taking
      the two-seater now. Why don't you let him take you too&mdash;that would
      save time&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Perfectly delighted to, Mr. Piper, of course, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Piper looks full at Oliver&mdash;a little strangely, Oliver thinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Piper begins, and then seems to change his mind
      for no apparent reason. &ldquo;No, I think the train would be better, I do not
      wish to get in too early, though I thank you, Oliver,&rdquo; he says with an
      old-fashioned bob of his head. &ldquo;And now I must really&mdash;a little food
      perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;and he escapes before either Oliver or Peter has time to
      argue the question. Oliver turns to Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Pete, if I'm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not. Oh <i>I'd</i> think it'd be a lot more sensible of Father to
      let you take him in, but you never can tell about Father. Something must
      be up, though, in spite of what he says&mdash;he's supposed to be on a
      vacation and I haven't seen him look the way he does tonight since some of
      the tight squeezes in the war.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XXXVI
    </h2>
    <p>
      It all started by having too much Mrs. Winters at a time, Nancy decided
      later. Mrs. Winters went down with comparative painlessness in homeopathic
      doses but Mrs. Winters day in and day out was too much like being forcibly
      fed with thick raspberry syrup. And then there had been walking up the
      Avenue from the Library alone the evening before&mdash;and remembering
      walks with Oliver&mdash;and coming across that copy of the &ldquo;Shropshire
      Lad&rdquo; in Mrs. Winters' bookcase and thinking just how Oliver's voice had
      sounded when he read it aloud to her&mdash;a process of some difficulty,
      she recalled, because he had tried to read with an arm around her. And
      then all the next day as she tried to work nothing but Oliver, Oliver,
      running through her mind softshoed like a light and tireless runner,
      crumbling all proper dignity and good resolutions away from her, little
      hard pebble by little hard pebble, till she had finally given up
      altogether, called up Vanamee and Company on the telephone and asked, with
      her heart in her mouth, if Mr. Oliver Crowe were there. The reply that
      came seemed unreal somehow&mdash;she had been so sure he would be and
      every nerve in her body had been so strung to wonder at what she was going
      to say or do when he finally answered, that the news that he had left
      three weeks before brought her down to earth as suddenly as if she had
      been tripped. All she could think of was that it must be because of her
      that Oliver had left the company&mdash;and illogically picture a starving
      Oliver painfully wandering the streets of New York and gazing at the food
      displayed in restaurant windows with lost and hopeless eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she shook herself&mdash;what nonsense&mdash;he must be at Melgrove.
      She couldn't call him up at Melgrove, though, he mightn't be there when
      she 'phoned and then his family would answer and what his family must
      think of her now, when they'd been so perfectly lovely when she and Oliver
      were first engaged&mdash;she shivered a little&mdash;no, that wouldn't do.
      And letters never really said things&mdash;it mustn't be letters&mdash;besides,
      she thought, humbly, it would be so awful to have Oliver send letters back
      unopened. Two weeks of pure Mrs. Winters had chastened Nancy to an unusual
      degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all that though, it was not until Mrs. Winters had left her alone for
      the evening after offering her an invitation to attend a little discussion
      group that met Wednesday evenings and read literary papers at each other,
      an invitation which Nancy somewhat stubbornly declined, that she finally
      made up her mind. Then she sighed and went to the telephone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Oliver Crowe? He is away on a visit just at present but we expect him
      back tomorrow afternoon.&rdquo; Margaret is pretending for her own satisfaction
      over the wire that the Crowes have a maid. &ldquo;Who is calling, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rather shakily, &ldquo;A f-friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Briskly. &ldquo;I understand. Well, he will be back tomorrow. Is that all that
      you wished to inquire? No message?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by then,&rdquo; and again Nancy thinks that things simply will not be
      dramatic no matter how hard she tries.
    </p>
    <p>
      She decides to take a small walk however&mdash;small because she simply
      must get to bed before Mrs. Winters comes back and starts talking at her
      improvingly. The walk seems to take her directly to the nearest Subway&mdash;and
      so to the Pennsylvania Station, where, after she has acquired a timetable
      of trains to Melgrove, she seems to be a good deal happier than she has
      been for some time. At least as she is going up the cake-colored stairs to
      the Arcade again she cannot help taking the last one with an irrepressible
      skip.

    <h2>
      XXXVII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver had quite a little time to think things over as the two-seater
      purred along smooth roads toward New York. The longer he thought them
      over, the less amiable some few of the things appeared. He formed and
      rejected a dozen more or less incredible hypotheses as to what possible
      connection there could be between Mrs. Severance and Sargent Piper&mdash;none
      of them seemed to fit entirely and yet there must be something perfectly
      simple, perfectly easy to explain&mdash;only what on earth could it be?
    </p>
    <p>
      He went looking through his mind for any scraps that might possibly piece
      together&mdash;of course he hadn't known Peter since College without
      finding out that in spite of their extreme politeness toward each other,
      Peter's mother and father really didn't get on. Club-stories came to him
      that he had tried to get away from&mdash;the kind of stories that were
      told about any prominent man, he supposed&mdash;a little leering paragraph
      in &ldquo;Town Gossip&rdquo;&mdash;a dozen words dropped with the easy assuredness of
      tone that meant the speakers were alluding to something that everyone knew
      by people who hadn't realized that he was Peter's friend. A caustically
      frank discussion of Mrs. Severance with Ted in one of Ted's bitter moods&mdash;a
      discussion that had given Oliver a bad half-hour later with Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But things like that didn't <i>happen</i>&mdash;people whose houses you
      stayed at&mdash;people your sister brought home over the week-end&mdash;the
      fathers of your own friends. And then Oliver winced as he remembered the
      afternoon when all the New Haven evening papers had screamed with
      headlines over the Witterly divorce suit&mdash;and Bob Witterly's leaving
      College because he couldn't stand it&mdash;that had been people you knew
      all right&mdash;and everyone had always had such a good time at the
      Witterlys' too.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all perfectly incredible of course&mdash;but he would have to find
      Ted just as soon as possible, no matter where he had to go to find him&mdash;and
      as the little reel of the speedometer began to hitch toward the left and
      into higher figures, Oliver felt very relieved indeed that he had the
      two-seater and that Mr. Piper wasn't coming into town till the 7.03.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got into New York to find he hadn't made as good time as he'd thought&mdash;a
      couple of traffic blocks had kept him back for valuable minutes&mdash;though
      of course the minutes couldn't be valuable exactly when it was all bosh
      about his having to get in so quickly after all. He went first to 252A
      Madison Avenue, hoping most heartily that Ted would be there on the fifth
      floor with his eyeshade over his eyes and large law-books crowding his
      desk, but the door was locked and knockings brought no response except a
      peevish voice from the other side of the narrow hall requesting any
      gentleman that was a gentleman to shut up for Gawd's sake. The Yale Club
      next&mdash;there was just a chance that Ted might be there&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver went through the Yale Club a good deal more thoroughly than most
      pages, from the lobby to the upstairs dining-room. He even invaded the
      library to the suspicious annoyance of some old uncle who was pretending
      to read a book held upside down in his lap in order to camouflage his
      pre-prandial nap. No Ted&mdash;though half-a-dozen acquaintances who
      insisted on saying hello and taking up time. Back to the street and a
      slight dispute with a policeman as regarded the place where Oliver had
      parked his car. He looked at his watch just before poking the self-starter&mdash;Mr.
      Piper's train must be halfway to New York by now. He set his lips and
      turned down 44th Street toward the Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourth floor Ted had said. The elevator went much too quickly for Oliver&mdash;he
      was standing in front of a most non-committal door-bell before he had
      arranged the racing tumult of thought in his mind enough to be in any
      measure sure of just what the devil he was going to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover he was oppressed by a familiar and stomachless sensation&mdash;the
      sensation he always had when he tried to high-dive and stood looking
      gingerly down from a shaky platform at water that seemed a thousand miles
      away and as flat and hard as a blue steel plate. There wasn't any guide in
      any Manual of Etiquette he had ever heard of on What to Say When
      Interrupting a Tete-a-Tete between Your Best Friend and a Dangerous And
      Beautiful Woman. He wondered idly if Ted would ever speak to him again&mdash;Mrs.
      Severance certainly wouldn't&mdash;and he rather imagined that even if Ted
      and Elinor did get married he would hardly be the welcome guest he had
      always expected to be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that was what you get for trying to pull a Jonathan when the Saul in
      question was behaving a good deal more like David in the affair with Uriah
      the Hittite's spouse&mdash;and it wasn't safe and Biblical and all done
      with a couple of thousand years ago but abashingly real and now happening
      directly under your own astonished eyes. He licked his lips a little
      nervously&mdash;they seemed to be rather dry. No use standing outside the
      door like a wooden statue of Unwelcome Propriety anyhow&mdash;the thing
      had to be done, that was all&mdash;and he pushed the bell-button with all
      the decision he could force into his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that it was not answered at once helped him a good deal by giving
      him a certain strength of annoyance. He pushed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs. Severance who answered it finally&mdash;and the moment he saw
      her face he knew with an immense invisible shock of relief how right he
      had been, for it was composed as an idol's but under the composure there
      was emotion, and, the moment she saw him, anger, as strong and steady and
      impassive as the color of a metal that is only white because it has been
      possessed to extremity already with all the burning heat that its
      substance can bear. She was dressed in some stuff that moved with her and
      was part of her as wholly as if it and her body had been made together out
      of light and gilded cloud&mdash;he had somehow never imagined that she
      could be as&mdash;lustrous&mdash;as that&mdash;it gave him the sensation
      that he had only seen her before when she was unlighted like an empty
      lantern, and that now there was such fire of light in her that the very
      glass that contained it seemed to be burning of itself. And then he
      realized that she had given him good-evening with an exquisite politeness,
      shaken hands and now was obviously waiting, with a little tired look of
      surprise around her mouth, to find out exactly why he was there at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gathered his wits&mdash;it wasn't fair, somehow, for her to be wearing
      that air of delicate astonishment at an unexpected call at dinner-time
      when he hadn't been invited&mdash;it forced him into being so casually
      polite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to break in on you like this, Mrs. Severance,&rdquo; he said with a
      ghastly feeling that after all he might be entirely wrong, and another
      that it was queer to have to be so formal, in the afternoon tea sense,
      with his words when his whole mind was boiling with pictures of everything
      from Ted as a modern Tannhauser in a New York Venusberg to triangular
      murder. &ldquo;I hope I'm not&mdash;disturbing you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no. No,&rdquo; and he suddenly felt a most complete if unwilling admiration
      for the utter finish with which she was playing her side of the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only you see,&rdquo; and this was Oliver doing his best at the ingenuous boy,
      &ldquo;Ted Billett, you know&mdash;he said he might be having dinner with you
      this evening&mdash;and I've got a very important letter for him&mdash;awful
      nuisance&mdash;don't see why it couldn't have gone in the mail by itself&mdash;but
      the man was absolutely insistent on my delivering it by hand.&rdquo; &ldquo;A letter?
      Oh yes. And they want an answer right away?&rdquo; Again Oliver realized
      grudgingly that whatever Mrs. Severance might be she was certainly not
      obvious. For &ldquo;I'm so glad you came then,&rdquo; she was saying with what seemed
      to be perfect sincerity. &ldquo;Won't you come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That little pucker that came and went in the white brow meant that she was
      sure that she could manage him, sure she could carry it off, Oliver
      imagined&mdash;and he was frank enough with himself to admit that he was
      not at all sure that she couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Ted&mdash;&rdquo; he heard her say, very coolly but also with considerable
      distinctness, as if her voice had to carry, &ldquo;there's a friend of yours
      here with a letter for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she had brought him inside and was apologizing for having the
      front room so badly lighted but one had to economize on light-bills,
      didn't one, even for a small apartment, and besides didn't it give one a
      little more the real feeling of evening? And Oliver was considering why,
      when if as he pressed the bell, he had felt so much like a modern St.
      George and wholly as if he were doing something rather fine and perilous,
      he should feel quite so much like a gauche seventeen-year-old now. He
      thought that he would not enjoy playing chess with Mrs. Severance. She was
      one of those people who smiled inoffensively at the end of a game and then
      said they thought it would really be a little evener if they gave you both
      knights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted reassured him though. Ted, stumbling out of the dining-room, with a
      mixture of would-be unconcern, compound embarrassment and complete though
      suppressed fury at Oliver on his face. It was hardly either just or moral,
      Oliver reflected, that Mrs. Severance should be the only one of them to
      seem completely at her ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Ollie,&rdquo; in the tone of &ldquo;And if you'd only get the hell out as
      quickly as possible.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mrs. Severance&mdash;&rdquo; a stumble over that. &ldquo;You've
      got a letter for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It's important,&rdquo; said Oliver as firmly as he could. He gave it, and,
      as Ted sat down near a lamp to read it, Oliver saw by one sudden momentary
      flash that passed over Mrs. Severance's face that she had seen the address
      and known instantly that the handwriting was not that of a man. And then
      Oliver began to think that he might have been right when he had thought of
      the present expedition as something rather perilous&mdash;he found that he
      had moved three steps away from Mrs. Severance without his knowing it,
      very much as he might have from an unfamiliar piece of furniture near
      which he was standing and which had instantaneously developed all the
      electric properties of a coil of live wire. Then he looked at Ted's face&mdash;and
      what he saw there made him want to kick himself for looking&mdash;because
      it is never proper for even the friendliest spectator to see a man's
      private soul stripped naked as a grass-stalk before his own eyes. It was
      horribly like watching Ted lose balance on the edge of a cliff that he had
      been walking unconcernedly and start to fall without crying out or any
      romantic gestures, with only that look of utter surprise struck into his
      face and the way his hands clutched as if they would tear some solid hold
      out of the air. Oliver kept his eyes on him in a frosty suspense while he
      read the letter all through three times and then folded it and put it
      carefully away in his breast pocket&mdash;and then when he looked at Mrs.
      Severance Oliver could have shouted aloud with immense improper joy, for
      he knew by the way Ted's hands moved that they were going back in the car
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted was on his feet and his voice was as grave as if he were apologizing
      for having insulted Mrs. Severance in public, but under the
      meaninglessness of his actual words it was wholly firm and controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry&mdash;I've got to go right away. You'll think me
      immensely rude but it's something that's practically life-and-death.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance and Oliver could have clapped his hands at
      her accent. Now that the battle had ended bloodlessly, he supposed he
      might be permitted to applaud, internally at least. And &ldquo;I'm sorry&mdash;but
      this is over,&rdquo; said every note in Ted's voice and &ldquo;Lost have I? Well then&mdash;&rdquo;
       every note in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Oliver that things were badly arranged&mdash;all this&mdash;and
      he was the only audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life seemed sudden lavish in giving him benefit performances of other
      people's love-affairs&mdash;he supposed it was all part of the old and
      deathless jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, like a prickling of cold, there passed over him once more that
      little sense of danger. Mrs. Severance and Ted were both standing looking
      at each other and neither was saying anything&mdash;and Ted looked by his
      face as if he were walking in his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The car's down below, old boy,&rdquo; said Oliver helpfully, and then, a little
      louder &ldquo;Peter's car, you know,&rdquo; and whatever cobwebs had been holding Ted
      for the last instant broke apart. He went over to Mrs. Severance.
      &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; and he started making apologies again while she merely looked
      and Oliver was suddenly fretting like a weary hostess whose callers have
      stayed hours too long, to have him down in the car and the car pointed
      again with its nose toward Southampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he heard, through Ted's last apologia, the whir of a mounting
      elevator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elevator couldn't stop at the fourth floor&mdash;it couldn't. But it
      did, and there was the noise of the gate slung back and &ldquo;<i>What's that?</i>&rdquo;
       said Mrs. Severance sharply, her politeness broken to bits for the first
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all standing near the door, and, with a complete disbelief in
      all that he was hearing and seeing, Oliver heard Mrs. Severance's voice in
      his ear, &ldquo;The kitchen&mdash;fire-escape&mdash;&rdquo; saw her push Ted toward
      him as if she were shifting a piece of cumbrous furniture, and obeyed her
      orders implicitly because he was too surprised to think of doing anything
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried himself and the still half-somnambulistic Ted through the
      dining-room curtains, just in time to catch a last glimpse of Mrs.
      Severance softly pressing with all her weight and strength against her
      side of the door of the apartment as a man's quick short footsteps crossed
      the hall in two strides, and after a second's pause, a key clicked into
      the lock.

    <h2>
      XXXVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Severance, her whole weight against the door, felt it push at her
      fiercely without opening, and, even in the midst of her turmoil, smiled.
      Mr. Severance had never been exactly what one would call an athlete&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She slackened her pressure, little by anxious little. Her hand crept down
      to the knob, then she jerked it sharply and stood back and Mr. Piper came
      stumbling into the room, a little too fast for dignity. He had to catch to
      her to save himself from falling but as soon as he had recovered his
      balance he jerked his hands away from her as if they had taken hold of
      something that hurt him and when he stood up she saw that his face was
      grey all over and that his breath came in little hard sniffs through his
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, Sargent,&rdquo; she said easily. &ldquo;I heard your key but that silly old
      door is sticking again. You didn't hurt yourself, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant she thought that everything was going to be perfectly
      simple&mdash;his face had changed so, with an intensity of relief almost
      childish, at the sound of her accustomed voice. Then the greyness came
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mind&mdash;introducing me&mdash;Rose&mdash;to the gentleman&mdash;you
      are dining with tonight?&rdquo; he said with a difficulty of speech as if actual
      words were not things he was accustomed to using. &ldquo;I merely&mdash;called&mdash;to
      be quite sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She managed to look as puzzled as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, the gentleman.&rdquo; He seemed neither to be particularly disgusted
      nor murderously angry&mdash;only so utterly tired in body and spirit that
      she thought oddly that it seemed almost as if any sudden gesture or
      movement might crumble him into pieces of fine grey paper at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there isn't any use in pretending, Rose&mdash;any more. I have my
      information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? From whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth does it matter? Elizabeth&mdash;since you choose to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elizabeth,&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance softly. She could not imagine how time,
      even when successfully played for and gained, could help the situation
      very much&mdash;but that was the only thing she could think of doing, and
      she did it, therefore, with every trick of deliberation she knew, as if
      any instant saved before he went into the dining-room might bring
      salvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I was always a little doubtful about Elizabeth. She was a
      little too beautifully incurious about everything to be quite real&mdash;and
      a little too well satisfied with her place, even on what we paid her. But
      of course is she has been supplementing her salary with private-detective
      work for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you were foolish enough to give her one of your private
      numbers,&rdquo; she said a trifle acidly. &ldquo;Which will mean that you will be
      paying her a modest blackmail all the rest of your life, and you'll
      probably have to provide for her in your will. Oh, I know Elizabeth!
      She'll be perfectly secret&mdash;if she's paid for it&mdash;she'll never
      make you willing to risk the scandal by asking for more than just enough.
      But if this is the way you carry on all your confidential investigations,
      Sargent&mdash;well, it's fortunate you have large means&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't know who I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Sargent, Sargent! When all she has to do is to subscribe to 'Town and
      Country.' Or call up the number you gave her, some time, and ask where it
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the strictest orders about nobody but myself ever answering the
      telephones in my private office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And servants are always perfectly obedient&mdash;and there are no stupid
      ones&mdash;and accidents never happen. Sargent, really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't matter. I didn't come here to talk about Elizabeth.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Really? I should think you might have. I could have given you all the
      information you required a good deal less expensively&mdash;and now, I
      suppose, I'll have to think up some way of getting rid of Elizabeth as
      well. I can't pay her off with one of my new dresses this time&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Who is he?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we start talking about it from the beginning, Sargent&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Where</i> is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the dining-room, I imagine. It wouldn't be very well bred of anyone,
      would it, to come out and be introduced in the middle of this very loud,
      very vulgar quarrel that you are making with me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sargent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me pass, Rose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not. Sargent, I will not let you make an absolute fool of yourself
      before my friends before you give me a chance to explain&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, I tell you! I will! <i>Let me go!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were struggling undignifiedly in the center of the room, her firm
      strong hands tight over his wrists as he pawed at her, trying to wrench
      himself away. Mr. Piper was a gentleman no longer&mdash;nor a business man&mdash;nor
      a figure of nation-wide importance&mdash;he was only a small furious
      figure with a face as grey and distorted as a fighting ape's who was
      clutching at the woman in front of him as if he would like to tear her
      with his hands. A red swimming had fallen over his eyes&mdash;all he knew
      was that the woman-person in front of him had fooled him more bitterly and
      commonly than anyone had been fooled since Adam&mdash;and that if he could
      not get loose in some way or other from the hateful strength that was
      holding him, he would burst into the disgusting tears of a vicious small
      boy who is being firmly held down and spanked by an older girl. Grammar,
      manners and sense had gone from him as completely as if he had never
      possessed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lemme go! oh damn you, damn you&mdash;you <i>woman</i>&mdash;you <i>devil&mdash;lemme</i>
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be <i>quiet,</i> Sargent! Oh shut up, you <i>fool, shut up!&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A noise came from the kitchen&mdash;a noise like the sound of a man
      falling over boxes. Mr. Piper struggled furiously&mdash;Paris was crawling
      out of the window&mdash;Paris, the sleek, sly chamberer, the gay hateful
      cuckoo of his private nest was getting away! Mrs. Severance turned her
      head toward the noise a second. Mr. Piper fought like a crippled wrestler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grr-ah! Ah, would you, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had wrenched one hand free for an instant&mdash;it went to his pocket
      and came out of it with something that shone and was hard like a new metal
      toy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Now</i> will you lemme go?&rdquo; But Mrs. Severance tried to grab for the
      hand with the revolver in it instead, and succeeded only in striking the
      barrel a little aside. There was a noise that sounded like a
      cannon-cracker bursting in Mr. Piper's face&mdash;it was so near&mdash;and
      then he was standing up, shaking all over, but free and a man ready to
      explain a number of very painful things to Paris as soon as he caught him.
      He took one step toward the dining-room, sheer rage tugging at his body as
      high wind tugs at a bough. Now that woman was out of the way&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he saw that she was out of the way indeed. She could not have
      fallen without his hearing her fall&mdash;how could she?&mdash;but she was
      lying on the floor in a crumple of clothes and one of her arms was thrown
      queerly out from her side as if it did not belong to her body any longer.
      He stood looking at her for what seemed one long endless wave of uncounted
      time and that firecracker noise he had heard kept echoing and echoing
      through his head like the sound of loud steps along a long and empty
      corridor. Then he suddenly dropped the pistol and knelt clumsily beside
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose! Rose!&rdquo; he started calling huskily, his hands feeling with frantic
      awkwardness for her pulse and her heart, as Oliver Crowe ran into the room
      through the curtains.

    <h2>
      XXXIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver thought that he had never been quite so sure of anything as he was
      that he must be insane. He was insane. Very shortly some heavy person in
      uniform would walk into the tidy kitchen where he and Ted were crouching
      like moving-picture husbands and remark with a kind smile that the Ahkoond
      of Whilom was giving a tea-party in the Mountains of the Moon that
      afternoon and that unless Oliver (or, as he was probable better known) St.
      Oliver, came back at once in the nice private car with the wire netting
      over its windows, everybody from God the Father Almighty to Carrie Chapman
      Catt would be highly displeased. For a moment Oliver thought of lunatic
      asylums almost lovingly&mdash;they had such fine high walls and smooth
      green lawns and you were so perfectly safe there from anything ever
      happening that was real. Then he jumped&mdash;that must be Mrs. Severance
      opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to <i>do</i>?&rdquo; he said to Ted in a fierce whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted looked at him stupidly. &ldquo;Do? When I don't know whether I'm on my feet
      or my head?&rdquo; he said. His drugged passiveness showed Oliver with
      desolating clarity that anything that could be done would have to be done
      by himself. He crept over toward the window with a wild wish that black
      magic were included in a Yale curriculum&mdash;the only really sensible
      thing he could think of doing would be for both of them to vanish through
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! Fire-escape!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fire-escape</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. You take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver had been sliding the window up all the while, cursing softly and
      horribly at each damnatory creak. Yes&mdash;there it was&mdash;and people
      thought fire-escapes ugly. Personally, Oliver had seldom seen anything in
      his life which combined concrete utility with abstract beauty so ideally
      as that little flight of iron steps leading down the entry outside the
      window into blackness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You first, Ted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't.&rdquo; The word seemed to come despairingly out of the bottom of his
      stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Came here. Own accord. Got to see it through. Take my medicine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fool, she doesn't want you here! Think of Elinor!&rdquo; For a moment
      Oliver thought Ted was going to blaze into more blind rage. Then he
      checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. But listen to that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voices that came to them from the living-room were certainly both high
      and excited&mdash;and the second that Oliver heard one of them he knew
      that all his most preposterous suppositions on the drive down from
      Southampton had come preposterously and rather ghastly true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>listen</i> to it! Do you know who the man is now? And will you
      get out on the fire-escape, you <i>fool</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ted listened intently for the space of a dozen seconds. Then &ldquo;Oh my God!&rdquo;
       he said and his head went into his hands. Oliver crept over to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ted, listen&mdash;oh listen, damn you! What's the use of acting the
      chivalrous fool, <i>now</i>? Don't you see? Don't you understand? Don't
      you get it that if you leave she can explain it some way or other&mdash;that
      all you're doing by staying is ruining yourself and Elinor for a point of
      honor that hasn't any honor <i>to</i> it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh sure. Sure. But listen to him&mdash;why great God, Ollie, if he has a
      gun he might kill her&mdash;probably will&mdash;Don't you see it's just
      because I hate the whole business now&mdash;and her&mdash;and myself&mdash;th'at
      I've got to stick it out? You go, Ollie, it's none of your business&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go. You blessed idiot, there's no use of both of us smashing. If
      anybody's got to stay&mdash;I can bluff it out a good deal better than you
      can&mdash;trust me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh rats. Not that it isn't very decent of you, Ollie, it is&mdash;and
      you'd do it&mdash;but I wouldn't even be a <i>person</i> to let you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both on their feet, talking in jerks, ears strained for every
      sound from that other room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's <i>perfectly</i> simple&mdash;nobody's going to pull any gunplay&mdash;good
      Lord, imagine poor old Mr. Piper&mdash;&rdquo; said Oliver uncertainly, and then
      as noises came to them that meant more than just talking, &ldquo;<i>Get down
      that fire-escape</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't. Let go of me, Ollie. I mustn't Listen&mdash;something's up&mdash;something
      bad! Get out of the way there, Ollie, I've got to go in! It <i>isn't</i>
      your funeral!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it isn't going to be yours!&rdquo; said Oliver through shut teeth&mdash;Ted's
      last remark had, somehow been a little too irritating. He thought savagely
      that there was only one way of dealing with completely honorable fools&mdash;Ted
      shouldn't, by the Lord!&mdash;-Oliver had gone to just a little too much
      trouble in the last dozen hours to build Ted a happy home to let any of
      Ted's personal wishes in the matter interrupt him now. He stepped back
      with a gesture of defeat but his feet gripped at the floor like a boxer's
      and his eyes fixed burningly on the point of Ted's jaw. Wait a
      split-second&mdash;he wasn't near enough&mdash;now&mdash;<i>there</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      His fist landed exactly where he had meant it to and for an instant he
      felt as if he had broken all the bones in his hand. Ted was back against
      the wall, his mouth dropping open, his whole face frozen like a face
      caught in a snapshot unawares to a sudden glare of immense and ludicrous
      astonishment. Then he began to give at the knees like a man who has been
      smitten with pie in a custard-comedy and Oliver recovered from his
      surprise at both of them sufficiently to step in and catch him as he
      slumped, face forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid him carefully down on the floor, trying feverishly to remember how
      long a knockout lasted. Not nearly long enough, anyway. Ropes. A gag. His
      eyes roved frantically about the kitchen. <i>Towels</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was filling Ted's mouth with clean dish-rag and thinking dully that it
      was just like handling a man in the last stages of alcohol&mdash;the body
      had the same limp refractory heaviness all over&mdash;when he heard
      something that sounded like the bursting of a large blown-up paper bag
      from the other room. He accepted the fact with neither surprise nor
      curiosity. Mr. Piper had shot Mrs. Severance. Or Mrs. Severance had shot
      Mr. Piper. That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had safely disposed of Ted&mdash;for an eery moment he had
      actually considered stowing him away in a drawer of the kitchen-cabinet&mdash;it
      might be well to go in and investigate the murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then either Mrs. Severance or Mr. Piper&mdash;whichever it was of the
      two that remained alive&mdash;might very well shoot him unless he or she
      had shot himself or herself first. It seemed to Oliver that the latter
      event would save everyone a great deal of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not relish the idea of being left alone in a perfectly strange
      apartment with two corpses and one gagged, bound and unconscious best
      friend&mdash;but he liked the picture of himself trying to make
      explanations to either his hostess or Mr. Piper when, in either case, the
      other party to the argument would be in possession of a loaded revolver,
      still less. He hoped that if Mrs. Severance were the survivor she had had
      a sufficiently Western upbringing at least to know how to shoot. He had no
      particular wish to die&mdash;but anything was better than being mangled&mdash;and
      a reminiscence of Hedda Gabler's poet's technique with firearms caused his
      stomach to contract quite painfully as he tightened the knots around Ted's
      ankles. Ted was the devil and all to get out on the fire-escape&mdash;and
      then you had to tie him so that he wouldn't roll off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crawled back through the window, dusted his trousers, and settled his
      necktie as carefully as if he were going to be married. Married. And he
      had hoped, he thought rather pitiably, that even though Nancy had so
      firmly decided to blight him forever she might have a few pleasant
      memories of their engagement at least. Instead&mdash;well, he could see
      the headlines now. &ldquo;Big Financier, Youth and Mystery Woman Die in Triple
      Slaying.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Dead</i>&mdash;Oliver Crowe, Yale 1917, of Melgrove, L. I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It hadn't been his job, damn it, it hadn't been his job at all. It was
      now, though, with Ted perfectly helpless on the fire-escape where any
      crazy person could take pot-shots at him as if he were a plaster pipe in a
      shooting gallery. The idea of escape had somehow never seriously occurred
      to him&mdash;what had happened in the evening already had impressed him so
      with a sense of inane fatality that he could not even conceive of the
      possibility of any-thing's coming right. In any event, Ted, tied up the
      way he was, was too heavy and clumsy to carry down even the most ordinary
      flight of stairs&mdash;and if he were going to be shot, he somehow
      preferred to gasp his last breaths out on a comfortably carpeted floor
      rather than clinging like a disreputable spider to the iron web of a
      fire-escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver sighed&mdash;Nancy's firmness had admittedly quite ruined all the
      better things in life&mdash;but even the merest sort of mere existence had
      got to be, at times, a rather pleasant convention&mdash;how pleasant, he
      felt, he had never quite realized somehow until just now. Then, with a
      vague idea of getting whatever was to happen over with as quickly and
      decently as possible, he settled his tie once more and trotted meekly
      through the dining-room and beyond the curtains.

    <h2>
      XL
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Piper!&rdquo; was Oliver's first and wholly inane remark.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was not what he had intended to say at all&mdash;something rather more
      dramatic and on the lines of &ldquo;Shoot if you must this old grey head, but if
      you will only listen to a reasonable explanation&mdash;&rdquo; had been
      uppermost in his mind. But the sight of Peter's father crouched over what
      must be Mrs. Severance's body, his weak hands fumbling for her wrist and
      heart, his voice thin with a senile sorrow as if he had been stricken at
      once and in an instant with a palsy of incurable age, brought the whole
      world of Southampton and house-parties and reality that Oliver thought he
      had lost touch with forever, back to him so vividly that all he could do
      was gape at the tableau on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Piper looked up and for a second of relief Oliver thought that the
      staring eyes had not recognized him at all. Then he realized from the look
      in them that who or what he was made singularly little difference now to
      Mr. Piper. &ldquo;Water!&rdquo; croaked Mr. Piper. &ldquo;Water! I've shot her. Oh, poor
      Rose, poor Rose!&rdquo; and he was plucking at her dress again with absorbed,
      incapable fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver looked around him. The gun. There must have been a gun. Where? Oh
      <i>there</i>&mdash;and as he picked it up from under a chair he did so
      with much inward reverence in spite of the haste he took to it, for he
      felt as if it were all the next forty years of his life made little into
      something cold and small and of metal that he was lifting like a doll from
      the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; said Mr. Piper again and quite horribly. &ldquo;Water for Rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was only when he had gone back to the kitchen and started looking for
      glasses that he realized that Mrs. Severance might very possibly be dying
      out there in the other room. Till then the mere fact that he was not dying
      himself had been too large in his vision to give him time to develop
      proper sympathy for others. When he did, though, he hurried bunglingly, in
      spite of a nervous flash in which after accidentally touching the revolver
      in his pocket he almost threw it through the pane of the nearest window
      before he considered. A moment, though, and he was back with a spilling
      tumbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; said Mr. Piper with querulous satisfaction. &ldquo;Give her water.&rdquo;
       Oliver hesitated. &ldquo;Where's she shot?&rdquo; he said sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Oh, I don't know. But I shot her. I shot her. Poor Rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly odd, there being no blood about, thought Oliver
      detachedly. Internal wounds? Possibly, but even so. He dipped his fingers
      in the glass of water, bent over Mrs. Severance and sprinkled the drops as
      near her closed eyelids as possible. No sound came from her and not a
      muscle of her body moved, but the delicate skin of the eyelids shivered
      momentarily. Oliver drew a long breath and stepped back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's dead,&rdquo; said Mr. Piper. &ldquo;She's dead.&rdquo; And he began to weep, very
      quietly with a mouselike sound and the slow horrible tears of age. &ldquo;No use
      trying water on her,&rdquo; said Oliver loudly, and again he thought he saw the
      skin of the eyelids twitch a little. &ldquo;Is there any brandy here&mdash;anything
      like that, Mr. Piper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;K-kitchen,&rdquo; said Mr. Piper with a sniff and one of his hands came away
      from Mrs. Severance to fumble for a key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go get it,&rdquo; said Oliver, still rather loudly, and took one step
      away. Then he bent down again swiftly and poured the whole contents of the
      tumbler he was holding into the little hollow of Mrs. Severance's throat
      just above the collar-bone. <i>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</i> said the dead Mrs. Severance in
      the tone of one who has turned on the cold in a shower unexpectedly, and
      she opened her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose!&rdquo; said Mr. Piper snifflingly. &ldquo;You aren't dead? You aren't dead,
      dear? Rose! Rose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance again, but this time tinily and with a flavor of
      third acts about her, and she started to relax rather beautifully into a
      Dying Gladiator pose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get some more water, Mr. Piper,&rdquo; said Oliver briskly, and Mrs.
      Severance began to sit up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;fainted&mdash;silly of me,&rdquo; she said with a consummate dazedness.
      &ldquo;Somebody was firing revolvers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried&mdash;I tried&mdash;I&mdash;t-tried to s-shoot you, Rose,&rdquo; came
      from the damp little heap on the floor that was Mr. Piper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Sargent&mdash;&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance comfortably. Then she turned
      her head and made what Oliver was always to consider her most perfect
      remark. &ldquo;You must think us very queer people indeed, Mr. Crowe?&rdquo; she said
      smiling questioningly up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver's smile in answer held relief beyond words. It wasn't the ordinary
      cosmos again&mdash;quite yet&mdash;but at least from now on he felt
      perfectly sure that no matter how irregular anyone's actions might become,
      in speech at least, every last least one of the social conventions would
      be scrupulously observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think&mdash;if you could help me, Sargent&mdash;&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance
      delicately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; from Mr. Piper very eagerly and with Oliver's and his
      assistance Mrs. Severance's invalid form was aided into a deep chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think, now,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that if I could have just a little&mdash;&rdquo;
       She let the implication float in the air like a pretty bubble. &ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;it
      might help us all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh <i>certainly,</i> dear,&rdquo; from Mr. Piper. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the kitchen, you said, Mr. Piper. And you must let <i>me,&rdquo;</i> from
      Oliver with complete decision. He hadn't bargained for that. Mr. Piper
      might not notice Ted on the fire-escape&mdash;but then again he might&mdash;and
      if he did he would certainly investigate&mdash;mute bound bodies were not
      ordinary or normal adjuncts of even the most illegal of Riverside Drive
      apartments. And then. Oliver's hand went down over the revolver in his
      pocket&mdash;if necessary he stood perfectly ready to hold up Mr. Piper at
      the point of his own pistol to preserve the inviolability of that kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Severance saved him the bother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would be so kind?&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;It's in the small cupboard&mdash;-the
      brown one&mdash;Sargent, you have the key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Rose.&rdquo; Mr. Piper was looking, Oliver thought, rather more
      embarrassed than it was fair for any man to have to look and live. His
      eyes kept going pitifully and always to Mrs. Severance and then creeping,
      away. He produced the key, however, and gave it to Oliver silently and
      Oliver took the first opportunity when he was through the curtains of
      giving whatever fates had presided over the insanities of the evening a
      long cheer with nine Mrs. Severances on the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carefully stayed in the kitchen fifteen minutes&mdash;devoting most of
      the time to a cautious examination of Ted, who seemed to be gradually
      recovering consciousness. At least he stirred a little when poked by
      Oliver's foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleeps just like a baby&mdash;oh, the sweet little fellow&mdash;the dear
      little fellow&mdash;&rdquo; hummed Oliver wildly as he made a few last additions
      to the curious network of string and towels with which he had wound Ted
      into the fire-escape as if he had been making him a cocoon. &ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;<i>well</i>&mdash;what
      a night we're having! What a night we're having and what <i>will</i> we
      have next?&rdquo; Then he remembered the reason for his journey and removed a
      bottle of brandy from the brown cup-board, found appropriate glasses and,
      in the ice-chest, club-soda and ginger ale. He poured himself a drink
      reminiscent of Paris&mdash;not that he felt he needed it for the reaction
      from bracing himself to die like a Pythias had left him elvishly grotesque
      in mind&mdash;gathered the bottles tenderly in his arms like small glass
      babies and went back to the living-room.

    <h2>
      XLI
    </h2>
    <p>
      And this time he was forced to pay internal high compliment to Mr. Piper
      as well as to Mrs. Severance. The pitiful grey image, its knees rumpled
      from the floor, its features streaked like a cheap paper mask with
      ludicrous dreadful tears, had turned back into the President of the
      Commercial Bank with branches in Bombay and Melbourne and all the
      business-capitals of the world. Not that Mr. Piper was at ease again,
      exactly&mdash;to be at ease under the circumstances would merely have
      proved him brightly inhuman&mdash;but he looked as Oliver thought he might
      have on one of the Street's Black Mondays when only complete firmness and
      complete audacity in one could keep even the Commercial afloat at a time
      when the Stock Exchange had turned into a floor-full of well-dressed
      maniacs and houses that everyone had thought as solid as granite went to
      pieces like sand castles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver set down the bottles and opened them with a feeling both that he
      had never known Mr. Piper at all before, only Peter's father, and,
      spookily, that neither Peter's father nor the terrible old man who had
      wept on the floor beside Mrs. Severance could have any real existence&mdash;this
      was such a complete and unemotional Mr. Piper he had before him, a Mr.
      Piper, too, in spite of all the oddities of the present situation, so
      obviously at home in his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of them said anything in particular until the mixture in the glasses
      had sunk about half-way down. Then Mr. Piper remarked in a pleasant voice,
      &ldquo;I don't often permit myself&mdash;seldom even before the country adopted
      prohibition&mdash;but the present circumstances seem to be&mdash;er&mdash;unusual
      enough&mdash;to warrant&mdash;&rdquo; smiled cheerfully and lifted his glass
      again. When he had set it down he looked at Mrs. Severance, then at
      Oliver, and then started to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver listened with some tenseness, knowing only that whatever he might
      possibly have imagined might happen, what would happen, to judge from the
      previous events of the evening, would be undoubtedly so entirely different
      that prophecy was no use at all. But, even so, he was not entirely
      prepared for the unexpectedness of Mr. Piper's first sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that I owe you very considerable apologies, Oliver,&rdquo; the President
      of the Commercial began with a good deal of stateliness. &ldquo;In fact I really
      owe you so many that it leaves me at rather a loss 'as to just how to
      begin.&rdquo; He smiled a little shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose has explained everything,&rdquo; he said, and Oliver looked at Mrs.
      Severance with stupefied wonder&mdash;<i>how?</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But even so, there remains the difficulty&mdash;of my putting myself into
      words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silly boy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance easily, and Oliver noted with fresh
      amazement that the term seemed to come from her as naturally and almost
      conventionally as if she had every legal American right to use it. &ldquo;Let
      me, dear.&rdquo; And Oliver felt his head begin to go round like a pinwheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then&mdash;but she really <i>couldn't</i> be married to Mr. Piper&mdash;and
      yet somehow she seemed so much more married to him than Mrs. Piper ever
      had been&mdash;Oliver's thoughts played fantastically for an instant over
      the proposition that she and Mr. Piper had been secretly converted to
      Mohammedanism together and he looked at Mr. Piper's grey head almost as if
      he expected to see a large red fez suddenly drop down upon it from the
      ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Rose,&rdquo; and again Mr. Piper's voice was stately. &ldquo;This is my&mdash;difficulty.
      No matter how hard it may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I did not understand&mdash;how could I?&mdash;that Rose&mdash;was
      such a very good friend of your sister's and all your family's. Rose had
      told me something about it, I believe&mdash;but I was so&mdash;foolishly
      disturbed&mdash;when I came in&mdash;that really, I&mdash;well I must
      admit that even if I had seen you when I first came in that would hardly
      have been the thought uppermost in my mind at the time.&rdquo; He spoke in the
      same tone of kindly reproof toward himself that he would have used if
      business worries had made him commit a small but definite act of
      inhospitality toward one of his guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And naturally&mdash;you will think me very ignorant indeed of my son's
      affairs&mdash;and those of his friends&mdash;but while I had heard from
      Peter&mdash;of the breaking of your engagement&mdash;you will pardon me, I
      hope, if I touch upon a subject that must be so painful to you&mdash;I had
      no idea of the fact that you were&mdash;intending to leave the country&mdash;and
      knowing Rose thought that with her present position on 'Mode'&mdash;&rdquo; he
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very kind indeed of Mrs. Severance to offer to do what she could
      for me,&rdquo; said Oliver non-committally. He thought he got the drift of the
      story now&mdash;a sheer one enough but with Mr. Piper's present reaction
      toward abasement and his obvious wish to believe whatever he could, it had
      evidently sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it was silly of me having Oliver to dinner here alone&mdash;&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Severance with the air of one ready to apologize for a very minor
      impropriety. &ldquo;Silly and wrong&mdash;but Louise was coming too until she
      telephoned about Jane Ellen's little upset&mdash;and I thought we could
      have such fun getting supper together with Elizabeth away. I get a little
      tired of <i>always</i> entertaining my friends in restaurants, Sargent,
      especially when I want to talk to them without having to shout. And <i>really</i>
      I never <i>imagined</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked steadily at Mr. Piper and he seemed to shrink a little under
      her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for Elizabeth,&rdquo; he said with hurried vindictiveness, &ldquo;Elizabeth shall
      leave tomorrow morning. She&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we might as well keep her, Sargent,&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance placidly.
      &ldquo;You will have to pay her blackmail, of course&mdash;but after all that's
      really your fault a little, isn't it?&mdash;and it seems as if that was
      more or less what you had to do with any kind of passable servant
      nowadays. And Elizabeth is perfection&mdash;as a servant. As police&mdash;&rdquo;
       she smiled a little cruelly. &ldquo;Well, we shan't go into that, but I think it
      would be so much better to keep her. Then we'll be getting something out
      of her in return for our blackmail, don't you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. Still we have no need of discussing that now. I can only say
      that if Elizabeth is to stay, she will have to&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Reform? My dear
      Sargent! When everything she did was from the most rigidly moral motives?
      I had no idea she was such a <i>clever</i> cat, though&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will have ample opportunities of exercising her cleverness in jail if
      I can find any means of getting her there, and I think I can. Really,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Piper reflectively, &ldquo;really when I think&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're still waiting for an&mdash;explanation&mdash;aren't you,
      Oliver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having been very nearly assassinated because of Elizabeth's abilities in
      telephone conversation, I should think he might very well be interested in
      knowing what is going to happen to her. However&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and Mr. Piper's face became very sober. He looked at his glass as
      if he would be willing to resign the Presidency of the Commercial in its
      favor if it would only explain to Oliver for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were saying, Sargent?&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance implacably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was. Well, I,&rdquo; he began, and then &ldquo;You,&rdquo; and stopped, and then he began
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that it would be&mdash;difficult&mdash;for me to explain matters
      to you fully, Oliver; I find it to be&mdash;even more difficult than I had
      supposed. I&mdash;it is rather hard for a man of my age to defend his
      manner of life to one of your age, even when he himself is wholly
      convinced that that manner is not&mdash;-unrighteous. And in this
      particular case, to one of his son's best friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He twisted his fingers around the rim of his glass. Oliver started to
      speak but Mr. Piper put up his hand. &ldquo;No&mdash;please&mdash;it will be so
      much easier if I finish what I have to say first,&rdquo; he said rather
      pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;the situation here between Rose and myself&mdash;must be plain
      to you now.&rdquo; Oliver nodded, he hoped in not too knowing a way. &ldquo;Plain. How
      that situation arose&mdash;is another matter. And a matter that would take
      a good deal too long to tell. Except that, given the premises from which
      we set forth&mdash;what followed was perhaps as inevitable as most things
      are in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That situation has been known to no other person on earth but ourselves&mdash;all
      these years. And now it is known. Well, Oliver, there you have it. And you
      happen to have us also&mdash;entirely in your hands. Because of a spying,
      greedy servant&mdash;and my own stupidity and distrust&mdash;we have been
      completely found out. And by one of my son's best friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that I could apologize for&mdash;all the scene before this.
      Better. I hope that you will believe that I am trying to do so now. But I
      seldom make apologies, Oliver, even when I am evidently in the wrong&mdash;and
      this hasn't been one of my easiest to make. And now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat back and waited, his fingers curled round his glass. And, as he
      looked at him, Oliver felt a little sickish, for, on the whole, he
      respected Mr. Piper a good deal more than his irreverent habit of mind
      permitted him to respect most older people, and at the same time felt
      pitifully sorry for him&mdash;it must be intensely humiliating to have to
      explain this way&mdash;and yet the only thing Oliver could do was to take
      the largest advantage possible of his very humiliation and
      straightforwardness&mdash;the truth could still do nothing at all but
      wreck everybody concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I give you my word of honor, Mr. Piper, to keep everything I know
      entirely and completely secret,&rdquo; said Oliver, slowly, trying to make the
      large words seem as little magniloquent as possible. &ldquo;That's all I can
      say, I guess&mdash;but it's true&mdash;you can really depend on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mr. Piper quite simply. &ldquo;I believe you, Oliver,&rdquo; and
      again Oliver felt that little burn of shame in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance, copying Mr. Piper finished his drink and
      rose. &ldquo;And now, I do not wish you to misunderstand me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have
      not come to my age without realizing that there are certain services that
      cannot be paid for. But you have done me a very great service, Oliver&mdash;a
      service for which I should have been glad to give nearly everything
      material that I possess. I merely wish you to know that in case you should
      ever need&mdash;assistance&mdash;from an older man&mdash;-in any way&mdash;that
      is clumsily put, but I can think of no other suitable word at the moment&mdash;I
      am entirely at your disposal. Entirely so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Oliver a little stiffly. Mr. Piper was certainly
      heaping coals of fire. Then he wondered for an instant just what Mrs.
      Ellicott would think if she could have heard the President of the
      Commercial say that to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Piper was moving slowly toward the door, and the politeness that had
      been his at the beginning of the conversation was nothing to his supreme
      politeness now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, as if he were asking everybody's pardon for an
      entirely unintentional intrusion, &ldquo;I really must be getting back to
      Southampton&mdash;and you and Rose I imagine have still quite a bit to
      talk over&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; said Oliver clumsily, &ldquo;but Mr. Piper&mdash;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Must you
      really, dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance in the softest tones of conventional
      wifely reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her manner was ideal but Oliver somehow and suddenly felt all the
      admiration he had ever had for her calm power blow away from him like
      smoke. He could not help extremest appreciation of her utter poise&mdash;he
      never would be able to, he supposed&mdash;but from now on it would be the
      somewhat shivery appreciation that anyone with sensitive nerves might give
      to the smooth mechanical efficiency of a perfectly-appointed
      electric-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Piper perfectly, &ldquo;I insist. You certainly could not have
      finished your discussion before I came and for the present&mdash;well&mdash;it
      seems to me that I have intruded quite long enough. I wish it,&rdquo; he added
      and Oliver understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are staying with us, over tomorrow, Oliver, are you not?&rdquo; said Mr.
      Piper calmly, and Oliver assented. &ldquo;I suppose we shall see each other at
      breakfast then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, sir.&rdquo; And then Oliver tried to rise to Mr. Piper's magnificence
      of conventionality in remark. &ldquo;By the way, sir, I'm driving back in
      Peter's car&mdash;as soon as Mrs. Severance and I have finished our talk&mdash;I
      couldn't pick you up anywhere, sir, could I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Piper smiled, consulting his watch. &ldquo;There is an excellent train at
      10.33&mdash;an excellent one&mdash;&rdquo; he said, and again Oliver was
      dumfounded to realize that the whole march of events in the apartment had
      taken scarcely two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Oliver, but I think I had better take that. Not that I
      distrust your driving in the least, but it will be fairly slow going, I
      imagine, over some of those roads at night&mdash;and this was one evening
      on which I had really intended to get a good night's sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled again very quaintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be dancing as soon as you get back, I suppose? I understand there
      is to be a dance this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&mdash;at least, I guess so. Told Peter I'd show up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Youth,&rdquo; said Mr. Piper. &ldquo;Youth.&rdquo; There was a certain accent of
      dolefulness in the way he said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I shall call a taxi,&rdquo; he said briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't I take you down&mdash;?&rdquo; Oliver began, but
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I insist,&rdquo; said Mr. Piper a little irritatedly, and then Oliver
      understood that though he might be quixotic on occasion, he was both human
      and&mdash;Oliver hesitated over the words, they seemed so odd to his youth
      to be using of a man who was certainly old enough to be his father&mdash;really
      in love with Mrs. Severance after all. So, until Mr. Piper's taxi came
      they chatted of indifferent matters much as they might have while watching
      people splashing about in the water from the porch of the swimming pool at
      Bar Harbor&mdash;and Oliver felt exceedingly in the way. These last dozen
      minutes were the hardest to get through of the whole evening, he thought
      rather dizzily; up till now he had almost forgotten about Ted, but it
      would be quite in keeping with everything else that had happened if just
      as Mr. Piper were leaving, a formal farewell on his lips and everything
      straightened out to everyone's conspiratorial or generously befooled
      satisfaction, Ted should stagger into the room like the galvanized corpse
      of a Pharoah wrapped in towels instead of mummy-cloth and everything from
      revolver-shots to a baring of inmost heart-histories would have to be gone
      through with again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when Oliver heard the telephone ring again he knew it was too good to
      be true, and, even when Mr. Piper started to answer it, was struck chilly
      with a hopeless fear that it might be police. But Fate had obviously got a
      trifle bored of her sport with them, or very possibly tired out by the
      intricacy of her previous combinations&mdash;for it was only the taxi
      after all and Mr. Piper was at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No use saying good-by to you now, is there, Oliver?&rdquo; he said quietly, but
      held out his hand nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-by, Rose,&rdquo; as he scrupulously shook hands with Mrs. Severance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Sargent,&rdquo; and then the door he had had such difficulty in
      opening two hours before had shut behind him and Oliver and Mrs. Severance
      were left looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance with a small gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said Oliver, and he walked over to the table and poured
      himself what he thought as he looked at it was very like the father and
      mother of all drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might&mdash;do something like that for me&mdash;&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance
      helplessly. &ldquo;If you did&mdash;I think&mdash;I might be able to think&mdash;oh,
      <i>well</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; repeated Oliver like a toast as he tipped the bottle and the drink
      which he poured for Mrs. Severance was so like unto his drink that it
      would have taken a fine millimeter-gauge to measure the difference between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Severance went back to her chair and Oliver sank into the chair that
      had been previously occupied by Mr. Piper. As he stretched back
      luxuriously something small and hard and bulging made him aware of itself
      in his pocket. &ldquo;Oh Lord, I forgot I still had that gun of Mr. Piper's!&rdquo;
       said Oliver inconsequentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance. The fact did not seem to strike her as
      being of any particular importance. They both drank long and frankly and
      thirstily, as if they were drinking well-water after having just come in
      from a hot mountain trail. And again, and for a considerable time, neither
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Mrs. Severance finally, with a blur of delicate scorn,
      &ldquo;I suppose our friend Mr. Billett&mdash;got away safely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her words brought up a picture of Ted to Oliver,&mdash;Ted netted like a
      fish out there on the fire-escape, swaddled up like a great papoose in all
      the towels and dish-cloths Oliver had been able to find. The release was
      too sudden, too great&mdash;the laughter came&mdash;the extreme laughter&mdash;the
      laughter like a giant. He swayed in his chair, choking and beating his
      knees and making strange lion-like sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ted,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Ted! Oh, no, Mrs. Severance, Ted didn't get away! He
      didn't get away at all&mdash;Ted didn't! He didn't because you see he <i>couldn't</i>.
      He's out on the fire-escape now&mdash;oh, wait till you see him, oh Ted,
      oh Glory, oh what a night, what a night, what a night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0043" id="link2H_4_0043">

    </div>
    <h2>
      XLII
    </h2>
    <p>
      It took a good deal of explaining, however, to make Ted understand. He was
      still tightly bound, though very angrily conscious when they found him and
      his language when Oliver removed the improvised gag was at first of such
      an army variety that Oliver wondered doubtfully if he hadn't better
      replace it until he got Ted alone. Also Oliver was forced to curse himself
      rather admiringly for the large number of unnecessary knots he had used,
      when he started to unravel his captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they finally got him completely untangled Ted's first remarks were
      hardly those of gratitude. He declared sulkily that his head felt as if it
      were going to split open, that he must have a bump on the back of it as
      big as a squash and that it wasn't Oliver's fault if he hadn't caught
      pneumonia out on that fire-escape&mdash;the air, believe him, was <i>cold</i>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Severance, however, and as usual, rose to the occasion and produced a
      bottle of witch-hazel from the bathroom with which she insisted on bathing
      the bump till Ted remarked disgruntledly that he smelt like a hospital.
      Oliver watched the domestic scene with frantic laughter tearing at his
      vitals&mdash;this was so entirely different and unromantic an end to the
      evening from that from which Oliver had set out to rescue Ted like a
      spectacled Mr. Grundy and which Ted in his gust of madness had so bitterly
      and grandiosely planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they moved back into the living-room and the story was related
      consecutively, by Oliver with fanciful adornments, by Mrs. Severance with
      a chill self-satisfaction that Oliver noticed with pleasure was like
      touching icicles to Ted. Ted gave his version&mdash;which only amounted to
      waking up on the fire-escape, trying to shout and succeeding merely in
      getting mouthfuls of towels&mdash;Oliver preened himself a little there&mdash;and
      lying there stoically and getting more and more furious until he was
      rescued. And while he told it he kept looking everywhere in the room but
      at Rose. And then Oliver remembered Mr. Piper and looked at his watch&mdash;11.04.
      He rose and gazed at Mrs. Severance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, and then caught her eye. It was chilly, doubtless, and
      even by Oliver's unconventional standards he could not think of her as
      anything but a highly dangerous and disreputable woman&mdash;but that eye
      was alive with an irony and humor that seemed to him for a moment more
      perfect than those in any person he had ever seen. &ldquo;<i>Must</i> you go?&rdquo;
       she said sweetly. &ldquo;It's been <i>such</i> an interesting party&mdash;so <i>original</i>,&rdquo;
       she hesitated. &ldquo;Isn't that the word? Of course,&rdquo; she shrugged, &ldquo;I can see
      that you're simply dying to get away and yet you can hardly complain that
      I haven't been an entertaining hostess, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; said Oliver meekly, and Ted said nothing&mdash;he merely looked
      down as if his eyes were augers and his only concern in life was screwing
      them into the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Must</i> you go?&rdquo; she repeated with merciless mocking. &ldquo;When it <i>has</i>
      been fun&mdash;and I don't suppose we'll ever see each other again in all
      our lives? For I can hardly come out to Melgrove now, can I, Oliver? And
      after you've had a quiet brotherly talk with her, I suppose I'll even have
      to give up lunching with Louise. And as for Ted&mdash;poor Ted&mdash;poor
      Mr. Billett with all his decorations of the Roller Towel, First Class&mdash;Mr.
      Billett must be a child that has been far too well burnt this evening,
      not, in any imaginable future to dread the fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both flushed, Ted deeper perhaps than Oliver, but neither answered. There
      really did not seem to be anything for them to say. She moved gently
      toward the door&mdash;the ideal hostess. And as she moved she talked and
      every word she said was a light little feathered barb that fell on them
      softly as snowflakes and stuck like tar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you won't mind if I send you wedding presents&mdash;both of you&mdash;oh,
      of course I'll be quite anonymous but it will be such a pleasure&mdash;if
      you'll both of you only marry nice homey girls!&rdquo; Ted started at this as if
      he had been walking barefoot and had stepped on a wasp and she caught him
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear, so Mr. Billett has serious intentions also&mdash;and I
      thought a little while ago that I was really in Mr. Billett's confidence&mdash;it
      only shows how little one can tell. As for Oliver, he of course is
      blighted&mdash;at present&mdash;but I'm sure that that will not last very
      long&mdash;one always finds most adequate consolation sooner or later
      though possibly not in the way in which one originally supposed.&rdquo; She
      sighed elfinly as Oliver muttered under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that, Oliver? Oh, no, I am not at all the sort of person that
      writes anonymous letters to one's wife&mdash;or family&mdash;or sister,&rdquo; a
      spaced little pause between each noun. &ldquo;And besides it wouldn't be much
      use in me, would it? for of course you young gentlemen will tell the young
      ladies you marry <i>everything</i> about yourselves&mdash;all honorable
      young people do. And then too,&rdquo; she spread out her hands, &ldquo;to be frank.
      We've all been so beautifully frank about ourselves tonight&mdash;that's
      one thing I <i>have</i> liked so much about the evening&mdash;well, it
      would hardly be worth my while to take lessons in blackmailing from
      Elizabeth if the only subjects on which I could apply them were two
      impecunious young men. And, oh, I realize most perfectly&mdash;and please
      don't misunderstand me!&mdash;that we're all of us thieves together so to
      speak and only getting along on each other's sufferance. But then, if one
      of us ever starts telling, even a little, he or she can hardly do so in
      any way that will redound to anything but his or her discredit and social
      obliteration&mdash;how nicely I've put that!&mdash;so I don't think any of
      us will be very anxious to tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Good</i>-by, Mr. Billett&mdash;and when you do marry, please send me
      an invitation&mdash;oh I shan't come, I've been far too well brought-up&mdash;but
      I must send&mdash;appreciations&mdash;and so must have the address. We
      have had a pleasant acquaintanceship together, haven't we?&mdash;perhaps a
      little more pleasant on my side than on yours&mdash;but even so it's <i>so</i>
      nice to think that nothing has ever happened that either of us could
      really regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just remember that the only person I could incriminate you to would be
      Mr. Piper, and not even there very much, due to Sargent's melodramatic
      appearance in the middle of dinner. But I shan't even there&mdash;it would
      mean incriminating myself a little too much too, don't you know? and even
      if the apartment here does get a trifle lonely one evening and another, I
      have got to be extraordinarily fond of it and I couldn't have nearly as
      nice a one&mdash;or as competent an Elizabeth&mdash;on what they pay me on
      'Mode.' So I'll keep it, I think, if you don't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that may make you a little more comfortable when you think things
      over&mdash;and I'm sure we all deserve to be very comfortable indeed for
      quite a long while after the very trying time we've just been through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Good</i>-by, and I assure you that even if I shall never be able to
      think of you in the future except as all wrapped up in the middle of those
      absurd towels, I shall think of you quite kindly though rather
      ridiculously nevertheless. And now if you will just run away a minute and
      wait down in that car of Sargent's that Oliver&mdash;borrowed&mdash;so
      effectively&mdash;because I must have one motherly word with Oliver alone
      before we part forever! Thank you so <i>much</i>! <i>Good</i>-by!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XLIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      So Oliver was left alone with her, he didn't know why. He noticed,
      however, that when she came to talk to him, though it was still with
      lightness, she was at no particular effort any longer to make the
      lightness anything but a method of dealing with wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Billett does not seem quite to appreciate exactly how much your
      timely pugilistics did for him,&rdquo; she observed. &ldquo;Or exactly how they might
      have affected you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver set his jaw, rather. He was hardly going to discuss what Ted might
      or might not owe him with Mrs. Severance. Hardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose you wouldn't,&rdquo; she said uncannily. Then she spoke again and
      this time if the tone was airy it was with the airiness of a defeated
      swordsman apologizing for having been killed by such a clumsy stroke of
      fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have some&mdash;comprehension&mdash;of just what you did. And
      besides&mdash;I seem to have a queer foible for telling the truth just
      now. Odd, isn't it, when I've been lying so successfully all evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very successfully,&rdquo; said Oliver, and, to his astonishment, saw her wince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;well. Well, I don't know quite why I'm keeping you here&mdash;though
      there was something I wanted to say to you, I believe&mdash;in a most
      serious and grandmotherly manner too&mdash;the way of a grown woman as
      Sargent would put it&mdash;poor Sargent&mdash;&rdquo; She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I remember now. It was only that I don't think you need&mdash;worry&mdash;about
      Mr. Billett any more. You see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Oliver with some incomprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing him done up that way in towels,&rdquo; she mused with a flicker of
      mirth. &ldquo;And the way he looked at me when I was telling about things
      afterwards&mdash;oh it wouldn't do, you know, Oliver, it wouldn't do! Your
      friend is&mdash;essentially&mdash;a&mdash;highly&mdash;Puritan&mdash;young
      man,&rdquo; she added slowly. Oliver started&mdash;that was one of the things so
      few people knew about Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;wholly. Even in the way he'd go to the devil. He'd do it
      with such a religious conviction&mdash;take it so <i>hard</i>. It would
      eat him up. Completely. And it isn't&mdash;amusing&mdash;to go to the
      devil with anybody whose diabolism would be so efficiently pious&mdash;a
      reversed kind of Presbyterianism. We wouldn't do that, you know&mdash;you
      or myself,&rdquo; and for an instant as she spoke Oliver felt what he
      characterized as a most damnable feeling of kinship with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true. Oliver had been struck with that during his army experiences&mdash;things
      somehow had never seemed to stick to him the way they had seemed to with
      Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is one reason that I feel so sure Mr. Billett will get on very well
      with Sargent's daughter&mdash;if his Puritan principles don't make him
      feel too much as if he were linking her for life to a lost soul,&rdquo; went on
      Mrs. Severance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Wha-a-at!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Oliver, whatever my failings may be, I have some penetration. Mr.
      Billett was garrulous at times, I fear&mdash;young men are so apt to be
      with older women. Oh <i>no</i>&mdash;he was beautifully sure that he was
      not betraying himself&mdash;the dear ostrich. And that letter&mdash;really
      that was clumsy of both of you, Oliver&mdash;when I could see the
      handwriting&mdash;all modern and well-bred girls seem to write the same
      curly kind of hand somehow&mdash;and then Sargent's address in embossed
      blue letters on the back. And I <i>couldn't</i> have suspected him of
      carrying on an intrigue with Mrs. Piper!&rdquo; and Oliver was forced to smile
      at her tinkle of laughter. Then she grew a little earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose it was&mdash;Mr. Billett&mdash;I wanted so&mdash;exactly,&rdquo;
       she mused. &ldquo;It was more&mdash;Mr. Billett's age&mdash;Mr. Billett's
      undeniable freshness&mdash;if you see. I'm not quite a Kipling vampire&mdash;no&mdash;a
      vampire that wants to crunch the bones&mdash;or do vampires crunch bones?
      I believe they only act like babies with bottles&mdash;nasty of them,
      isn't it?&mdash;But one gets to a definite age&mdash;and Sargent's a dear
      but he has all the defects of a husband&mdash;and things begin slipping
      away, slipping away&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made a motion of sifting between her hands, letting fall light grains
      of a precious substance that the hands were no longer young enough to
      keep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And life goes so queerly and keeps moving on like a tramp in front of a
      policeman till you've started being gray and taking off your corset every
      time you're alone because you like being comfortable better than having a
      waist-line&mdash;and you've never had anything to settle you,&rdquo; her face
      twitched, &ldquo;not children&mdash;nor even the security of marriage&mdash;nothing
      but work that only interests part of you&mdash;and this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spread her hands at the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;what a lot of nonsense I'm talking&mdash;and keeping Mr.
      Billett out in the car when he's sure he has pneumonia already&mdash;how
      unkind of me. You must think me a very immoral old woman, don't you,
      Oliver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you're very sporting,&rdquo; said Oliver, truthfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very. If I really <i>wanted</i> Mr. Billett, you see.&rdquo; Her eyes
      sparkled. &ldquo;I'm afraid you wouldn't think me sporting at all&mdash;in that
      case. But then I don't think you'd have been able to&mdash;save&mdash;anybody
      I really wanted as you did Mr. Billett.&rdquo; She spoke slowly. &ldquo;Even with that
      very capable looking right hand. But in case you're still worried&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not, really.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paid no attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In case you're still worried&mdash;what I told Mr. Billett was true. In
      the first place, Sargent would never believe me, anyway. In the second
      place it would mean breaking with Sargent&mdash;and do you know I'm rather
      fond of Sargent in my own way?&mdash;and a thing like that&mdash;well, you
      saw how he was tonight&mdash;it would mean more things like revolvers and
      I <i>hate</i> revolvers. And hurting Sargent&mdash;and ruining Mr. Billett
      who is a genuinely nice boy and can't help being a Puritan, though I never
      shall forget the way he looked in those towels. Still, I'm rather fond of
      him too&mdash;oh, I'm perfectly unashamed about it, it's quite in an aunty
      way now and he'll never see me again if he can help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And making Sargent's daughter&mdash;who must be charming from what I hear
      of her&mdash;but charming or not, she happens to be a woman and I have a
      feeling that, being a woman, life will hurt her quite sufficiently without
      my adding my wholly vicarious share. Oh, I'm perfectly harmless now,
      Oliver,&rdquo; she made a pretty gesture with her hands. &ldquo;You and Sargent and
      the fire-escape between you have drawn my fangs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't exactly&mdash;thank you,&rdquo; said Oliver, &ldquo;but I do repeat&mdash;you're
      sporting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never repeat a compliment to a woman over twenty and seldom then.&rdquo; She
      looked at him reflectively. &ldquo;The same woman, that is. There is such a
      great deal I could teach you though, really,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You're much more
      teachable than Mr. Billett, for instance,&rdquo; and Oliver felt a little
      shudder of terror go through him for a moment at the way she said it. But
      she laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't worry. And besides, you're blighted, aren't you?&mdash;and
      they're unteachable till they recover. Well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, there was something else I meant to be serious about. Sargent
      said something about our&mdash;disappearing, and all that. Well, Sargent
      has always been enamored of puttering around a garden somewhere in an
      alias and old trousers with me to make him lemonade when he gets
      overheated&mdash;and so far I've humored him&mdash;but I've really never
      thought very much of the idea. That would be&mdash;for me&mdash;a
      particularly stupid way of going to seed.&rdquo; She was wholly in earnest now.
      &ldquo;And I haven't the slightest intention of going to seed with Sargent or
      anybody else for a very long time yet. If it ever comes definitely to that
      I shall break with Sargent; you can depend on my selfishness&mdash;arrogance&mdash;anything
      you like for that. Quite depend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tonight,&rdquo; she hesitated. &ldquo;Tonight has really made a good many things&mdash;clear
      to me. Things that were moving around in my mind, though I didn't know
      quite what to call them. For one thing, it has made me&mdash;realize,&rdquo; her
      eyes darkened, &ldquo;that my time for really being&mdash;a woman&mdash;not in
      the copybook sense&mdash;is diminishing. Getting short. Oh, you and Mr.
      Billett will have to reconcile your knowledge of Sargent's and my
      situation with whatever moral ideas you may happen to have on
      fathers-in-law and friends' fathers for some time yet&mdash;I'm sure I
      don't know how you're going to do it, especially Mr. Billett, and I can't
      honestly say that I particularly care. But that will not be&mdash;permanent,
      I imagine. You understand?&rdquo; She put her hand on the door-knob to imply
      that the audience was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall miss Louise, though,&rdquo; she said, frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise will miss you.&rdquo; Oliver saw no need for being politic now. He added
      hesitatingly, &ldquo;After all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. No,&rdquo; she said lightly but very firmly. &ldquo;I couldn't very well,
      now, could I?&rdquo; and Oliver, in spite of all the broadmindedness upon which
      he prided himself, was left rather dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it won't be&mdash;difficult,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;We can keep up&mdash;in the
      office&mdash;yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Oliver hastily. He might be signing a compact with all the
      powers of darkness, but even so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the rest, I am&mdash;used to things like that,&rdquo; she added, and once
      again her face grew suddenly bright with pain. Then she recovered herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;our next merry meeting and so forth,&rdquo; she said airily.
      &ldquo;Because when it happens, if it does, I may be so stodgily respectable
      you'll be very glad to ask me to dinner, you know. Or I may be&mdash;completely
      disreputable&mdash;one never knows. But in any case,&rdquo; and she gave her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Billett must be freezing to death in that car,&rdquo; she murmured.
      &ldquo;Good-by, Oliver, and my best if wholly unrespectable good wishes.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Thanks and&mdash;good luck to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned on him swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. All the happiness in the world and <i>no</i> luck&mdash;-that's
      better, isn't it? <i>Good</i>-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Oliver was out in the hall, pressing the button that would summon
      a sleepy, disgruntled elevator-boy to take him down to Ted and the car. He
      decided as he waited that few conversations he had ever had made him feel
      quite so inescapably, irritatingly young; that he saw to the last inch of
      exactitude just why Mr. Piper completely and Ted very nearly had fallen in
      love with Mrs. Severance; that she was one of the most remarkable
      individuals he had ever met; and that he hoped from the bottom of his
      heart he never, never saw her again.

    <p>
      Ted and he had little conversation going back in the car. The most
      important part of it occurred when they had left New York behind and were
      rushing along cool moon-strewn roads to Southampton. Then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Ted suddenly and fervently and did not seem to be able to
      say anything more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The events of the evening had come too close, at moments, to grotesque
      tragedy for Oliver to pretend to misunderstand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right. And anyhow I owed you one for that time with the
      gendarmes in Brest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; but Ted didn't seem to be convinced. &ldquo;That was jocose though.
      Even at the worst.&rdquo; The words came with effort. &ldquo;This was&mdash;serious. I
      owe you about everything, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go take a flying leap at a galloping goose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go do it yourself. Oh, Oliver, you ass, I <i>will</i> be pretty and
      polite about your saving my life.&rdquo; And both laughed and felt easier.
      &ldquo;Saved a good deal more than that as a matter of fact&mdash;or what counts
      for more with me,&rdquo; Ted added soberly. &ldquo;Then the letter I brought <i>was</i>
      satisfactory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satisfactory? Gee!&rdquo; said Ted intensely, and again they fell silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some miles later Oliver added casually
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't have any trouble with our late hostess, by the way. Though she
      knows all about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver couldn't resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And quite approves. But she's&mdash;a sport.&rdquo; Then for Ted's sake,
      &ldquo;Besides, you see, it would crab her game completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell Elinor, though,&rdquo; said Ted, stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About her father? You can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, no. About myself. Don't have to give names and addresses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;afterwards. Though it makes me feel like a swine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody our age who hasn't been one or felt like one&mdash;some of the
      time&mdash;except Christers and the dead,&rdquo; said Oliver, and they proceeded
      for several minutes on the profundity of that aphorism. The silence was
      broken by Ted's saying violently,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>will</i> marry her! I don't give a damn what's happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good egg. Of course you will.&rdquo; Oliver chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ted turned to him anxiously after another silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look Ollie, that bump on my head&mdash;you've seen the size it is. Well,
      is it going to just show up like <i>thunder</i> at this silly dance?&rdquo;

    <p>
      Half-past five in the morning and Oliver undressing wearily by the light
      of a pale pink dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then he looks at his bed with a gloating expression that almost
      reaches the proportions of a lust&mdash;he is so tired he can hardly get
      off his clothes. The affairs of the last twenty-four hours mix in his mind
      like a jumble of colored postcards, all loose and disconnected and
      brightly unreal. Ted&mdash;Elinor&mdash;Mrs. Severance&mdash;Mr. Piper&mdash;the
      dance he has just left&mdash;sleep&mdash;oh&mdash;sleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is Ted? Somewhere with Elinor of course&mdash;it doesn't matter&mdash;both
      were looking suspiciously starry when he last saw them across the room&mdash;engagements&mdash;marriages&mdash;sleep&mdash;Mr.
      Piper's revolver&mdash;sleep. How will he return Mr. Piper's revolver?
      Can't do it tactfully&mdash;can't leave it around to be lost, the servants
      are too efficient&mdash;send it to Ted and Elinor as a wedding present&mdash;no,
      that's not tactful either&mdash;what silly thoughts&mdash;might have been
      dead by this time&mdash;rather better, being alive&mdash;and in bed&mdash;and
      asleep&mdash;and asleep. Oh, <i>bed!</i> and he falls into it as if he
      were diving into butter and though he murmurs &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; once to himself
      before his head sinks into pillows, in two seconds he is drugged with such
      utter slumber that it is only the blind stupefied face of a man under
      ether that he is able to lift from his haven when Ted comes in half an
      hour later and announces, in the voice of one proclaiming a new
      revelation, that Elinor is the finest person that ever lived and that
      everything is most wholly and completely all right.

    <h2>
      XLVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &ldquo;A letter for you, dear Nancy.&rdquo;
     </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Winters gestures at it refinedly&mdash;she never points&mdash;as
      Nancy comes in to breakfast looking as if whatever sleep she had had not
      done her very much good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From your dear, dear mother, I should imagine,&rdquo; she adds in sugared
      watery tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy opens it without much interest&mdash;Mother, oh, yes, Mother. Six
      crossed pages of St. Louis gossip and wanderingly fluent advice. She sets
      herself to read it, though, dutifully enough&mdash;she is under Mrs.
      Winters' eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father's usual September cold. The evil ways of friends' servants. Good
      wishes to Mrs. Winters. &ldquo;Heart's Gold&mdash;such a really <i>inspiring</i>
      moving-picture.&rdquo; Advice. Advice. Then, half-way down the next to last page
      Nancy stops puzzledly. She doesn't quite understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hope, my daughter, that now you are really cured though you may have
      passed through bitter waters but all such things are but God's divine will
      to chasten us. And when the young man told me of his <i>escapade</i> I
      felt that even over the telephone he might have&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sets herself wearily to decode some sort of definite meaning out of
      Mother's elliptic style. An escapade. Of Oliver? and over the telephone&mdash;what
      was that? Mother hadn't said anything&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She finishes the letter and then rereads all the parts of it that seem to
      have any bearing on the cryptogram, and finally near the end, and
      evidently connected with the &ldquo;telephone,&rdquo; she comes upon the phrase &ldquo;that
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There is only one day that Mother alludes to as &ldquo;That Day&rdquo; now. Before her
      broken engagement &ldquo;That Day&rdquo; was when Father failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Oliver <i>hadn't</i> telephoned&mdash;she'd asked Mother <i>particularly</i>
      if he had, and he hadn't. But surely if he had telephoned, surely, surely,
      Mother would have told her about it&mdash;Mother would have known that
      there were a few things where she really hadn't any right to interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother had never liked Oliver, though she'd pretended. Never.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy remembers back and with fatally clear vision. It is fortunate that
      Mrs. Ellicott cannot turn over with Nancy that little shelf-full of
      memories&mdash;all the small places where she was not quite truthful with
      Nancy, where she was not quite fair, where she &ldquo;kept things from her&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs.
      Ellicott has always been the kind of woman who believes in &ldquo;keeping things
      from&rdquo; people as long as possible and then &ldquo;breaking them gently.&rdquo; Almost
      any sort of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is still more fortunate that Mrs. Ellicott cannot see Nancy's eyes as
      she reviews all the tiny deceptions, all the petty affairs about which she
      was never told or trusted&mdash;and all for her own best interests, my
      dear, Mrs. Ellicott would most believingly assure her&mdash;but when
      parents stand so much in Loco Dei to nearly all children&mdash;and when
      the children have long ago found out that their God is not only a jealous
      God but one that must be wheedled and propitiated like an early Jehovah
      because that is the only thing to be done with Gods you can't trust&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy doesn't <i>want</i> to believe. She keeps telling herself that she
      won't, she absolutely won't unless she absolutely has to. But she is lucky
      or unlucky enough to be a person of some intuition&mdash;she knows Oliver,
      and, also, she knows her mother&mdash;though now she is beginning to think
      with an empty feeling that she really doesn't know the latter at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      What facts there are are rather like Mrs. Ellicott's handwriting&mdash;vague
      and crossed and illegibly hard to read. But Nancy stares at them all the
      time that she is eating her breakfast and responding mechanically to Mrs.
      Winters' questions. And then, suddenly, she <i>knows</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellicott like many inexperienced criminals, has committed the deadly
      error of letting her mind dwell too long on the <i>mise-en-scene</i> of
      her crime. And her pen&mdash;that tell-tale pen that all her life she has
      taken a delight almost sensual in letting run on from unwieldy sentence to
      pious formless sentence, has at last betrayed her completely. There is
      genuine tragedy in store for Mrs. Ellicott&mdash;Nancy in spite of being
      modern, is Nancy and will forgive her&mdash;but Nancy, for all her trying,
      will never quite be able to respect her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy doesn't finish her breakfast as neatly as Mrs. Winters would have
      wished. She goes into the next room to telephone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business, dear?&rdquo; says Mrs. Winters brightly from the midst of a last
      piece of toast and &ldquo;Yes&mdash;something Mother wants me to do&rdquo; from Nancy,
      unfairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she gives the number&mdash;it is still the same number she and Oliver
      used when they used to talk after he had caught the last train back to
      Melgrove and both by all principles that make for the Life Efficient
      should have gone to bed&mdash;though to Nancy's mind that seems a great
      while ago. &ldquo;Can I speak to Mrs. Crowe, please?&rdquo; The explaining can be as
      awful as it likes, Nancy doesn't care any more. An agitated rustle comes
      to her ears&mdash;that must be Mrs. Winters listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Crowe? This&mdash;is&mdash;Nancy&mdash;Ellicott.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She says it very loudly and distinctly and for Mrs. Winters to hear.

    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver wakes around one o'clock with a dim consciousness that noisy crowds
      of people have been talking very loudly at him a good many too many times
      during the past few hours, but that he has managed to fool them, many or
      few, by always acting as much like a Body as possible. His chief wish is
      to turn over on the other side and sleep for another seven hours or so,
      but one of those people is standing respectfully beside his bed and though
      Oliver blinks eyes at him reproachfully, he will not vanish back into his
      proper nonentity&mdash;he remains standing there&mdash;obsequious words
      come out of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes to one, sir. Lunch is at one, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver stares at the blue waistcoat gloomily. &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten minutes to one, sir. Lunch is at one, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'd better get up, I suppose. Ow-<i>ooh!</i>&rdquo; as he stretches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. A bath, sir?&rdquo; &ldquo;Bath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, bath. No&mdash;don't bother&mdash;I mean, I'll take it myself.
      You needn't watch me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly <i>not</i>, sir. Thank you, sir. There have been several
      telephone calls for you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver sighs&mdash;he is really awake now&mdash;it will be less trouble to
      get up than to try and go back to sleep. Besides, if he tries, that
      brass-buttoned automaton in front of him will probably start shaking him
      gently in its well-trained English way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telephone calls? Who telephone-called?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The name was Crowe, sir. The lady who was calling said she would call
      again around lunch time. She said you were to be sure to wait until she
      called, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly.&rdquo; Politely, &ldquo;And now I think I'll get up, if you don't
      mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; rather scandalizedly. &ldquo;You are in need of nothing, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver thinks of replying, &ldquo;Oh, just bring me a little more sleep if you
      have it in the house,&rdquo; but then thinks better of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; and the automaton pussyfoots away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver still half asleep manages to rise and find slippers and a wrapper
      and then pads over to an empty bathroom where he disports himself like a
      whale. To his surprise he discovers himself whistling&mdash;true, the
      sunlight has an excellent shine to it this morning and the air and the sky
      outside seem blue and crisp with first fall&mdash;but even so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy,&rdquo; he murmurs and frowns and finishes his bath rather gloomily&mdash;a
      gloom which is in no wise diminished when he goes downstairs to find
      everybody nearly through lunch and Ted and Elinor, as far away from each
      other at the table as possible, quite sure that they are behaving exactly
      as usual while the remnants of the house-party do their best to seem
      tactfully unconcerned.

    <p>
      Oliver, while managing to get through a copious and excellent lunch in
      spite of his sorrows, regards them with the morose pity of a dyspeptic
      octogenarian for healthy children. It is all very well and beautiful for
      them now, he supposes grimly, but sooner or later even such babes as they
      will have to Face Life&mdash;Come Up Against Facts&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He is having a second piece of blueberry pie when he is summoned to the
      telephone. Rather tiresome of Mother, really, he thinks as he goes out of
      the dining-room&mdash;something about his laundry again most probably&mdash;or
      when he is coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Oliver?&rdquo; &ldquo;Hello, dear. Anything important?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crowe's voice has a tiny chuckle in it&mdash;a chuckle that only
      comes when Mrs. Crowe is being very pleased indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Oliver, that depends&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mother, <i>honestly</i>! I'm right in the middle of lunch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll call up again, if you'd rather, Oliver dear.&rdquo; But Mrs. Crowe for
      private reasons doesn't seem to be at all ashamed of taking up so much of
      her son's very valuable time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only I <i>did</i> think it would interest you&mdash;that you'd like to
      know as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Impatiently, &ldquo;Yes. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;a friend of yours is coming to see you on the three o'clock. A
      <i>rather</i> good friend. We thought you'd be back by then, you see, and
      so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver's heart jumps queerly for an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Who</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the imp of the perverse has taken complete charge of Mrs. Crowe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;a friend. Not a childhood one&mdash;oh, no&mdash;but a&mdash;good&mdash;one,
      though you haven't seen each other for&mdash;more than three weeks now,
      isn't it? You should just be able to make it, I should think, if somebody
      brought you over in a car, but of course, if you're so busy&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Mother</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Oliver jangles the little hook of the telephone frantically up and
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother! Listen! Listen! Who is it? Is it&mdash;honestly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Crowe has hung up. Shall he get the connection again? But that
      means waiting&mdash;and Mother said he would just be able to make it&mdash;and
      Mother isn't at all the kind that would fool him over a thing like this no
      matter how much she wanted to tease. Oliver bounds back toward the
      dining-room and nearly runs into Elinor Piper. He grabs her by the
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, El!&rdquo; he says feverishly. &ldquo;Oh, I'll congratulate you properly and
      all that some time but this is utterly everything&mdash;I've got to go
      home right away&mdash;this minute&mdash;toot sweet&mdash;and no, by gum, I
      won't apologize <i>this</i> time for asking you to get somebody to take me
      over in a car!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XLVIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      She was sitting on the porch of the house&mdash;a small figure in the
      close blue hat he knew, a figure that seemed as if it had come tired from
      a long journey. She had been talking with his mother, but as soon as the
      car drew up, Mrs. Crowe rose quickly and went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they were together again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant paid them for all. For the last weeks' bitterness and the
      human doubt, the human misunderstandings that had made it. And even as it
      opened before them a path some corners and resting-places of which seemed
      almost too proud with living for them to dare to be alive on it&mdash;both
      knew that that fidelity which is intense and of the soul had ended between
      them forever an emptier arrogance that both had once delighted in like
      bright colors&mdash;a brittle pride that lives only by the falser things
      in being young.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had thought they were sure of each other in their first weeks
      together&mdash;they had said many words about it and some of them clever
      enough. But their surety now had no need of any words at all&mdash;it had
      been too well tempered by desolation to find any obligation for speech or
      the calling of itself secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      They kissed&mdash;not as a pleasant gesture, and no fear of looking
      publicly ridiculous stopped them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The screen door behind Nancy pushed open. Jane Ellen appeared, Jane Ellen,
      by the look of her, intent upon secret and doubtful business, a large
      moth-eaten bear dangling by its leg from one of her plump hands. She was
      too concerned with getting her charge through the door to notice what was
      happening at first but as soon as she was fairly out on the porch she
      looked about her. The bear dropped from her fingers&mdash;her eyes grew
      rounder than buttons and very large.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why it's Oliver and he's kissing Aunt <i>Nancy</i>!&rdquo; she squeaked in a
      small voice of reproachful surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0050" id="link2H_4_0050">
      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>
    </p>
    <div style="height: 4em;">
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </div>
    <h2>
      XLIX
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whatever the number was of the second-class stateroom on the <i>Citric</i>,
      it was rather too far down in the belly of that leviathan to have suited
      fashionable people. But Oliver and Nancy had stopped being fashionable
      some time before and they told each other that it was <i>much</i> nicer
      than first-class on one of the small liners with apparent conviction and
      never got tired of rejoicing at their luck in its being an outside. It was
      true that the port-hole might most of the time have been wholly ornamental
      for all the good it did them, for it was generally splashed with grey
      October sea, but, at least, as Nancy lucently explained, you could see
      things&mdash;once there had actually been a porpoise&mdash;and that
      neither of them, in their present condition, would have worried very much
      about it if their cabin had been an aquarium was a fact beyond dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time to get up, dear!&rdquo; This is Oliver a little sternly from the upper
      berth. &ldquo;That was your bath that came in a minute ago and said something in
      Cockney. At least I <i>think</i> it was&mdash;mine's voice is a good deal
      more like one of Peter's butlers&mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;But, Ollie, I'm so <i>comfortable</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I. But think of breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;breakfast is a point.&rdquo; Then she chuckles, &ldquo;Oh, Ollie, wouldn't
      it have been <i>awful</i> if we'd either of us been bad sailors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn't have been,&rdquo; says Oliver placidly. &ldquo;We have too much luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know but&mdash;that awful woman with the face like a green pea&mdash;oh,
      Ollie, you'd have hated me&mdash;we are lucky, darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver has thought seriously enough about getting up to be dangling his
      legs over the edge of his shelf by now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't we?&rdquo; he says soberly. &ldquo;I mean I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> am. And everybody's being so nice about giving us checks we can
      use instead of a lot of silly things we wouldn't know what to do with.&rdquo;
       She smiles. &ldquo;Those are your feet,&rdquo; she announces gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing. Only I'm going to tickle them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not? Ouch&mdash;Nancy, you <i>little devil</i>!&rdquo; and Oliver slides
      hastily to the floor. Then he goes over to the port-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A very nice day!&rdquo; he announces in the face of a bull's eye view of dull
      skies and oily dripping sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? How kind of it! Ollie, I must get up.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nancy, you must.&rdquo; He goes
      over and kneels awkwardly by the side of her berth&mdash;an absurd figure
      enough no doubt in tortoise-shell spectacles and striped pajamas, but
      Nancy doesn't think so. As for him he simply knows he never will get used
      to having her with him this way all the time; he takes his breath
      delicately whenever he thinks of it, as if, if he weren't very careful
      always about being quiet she might disappear any instant like a fairy back
      into a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kisses her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her arms go round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't that I don't want to get up, really,&rdquo; she explains presently.
      &ldquo;It's only that I like lying here and thinking about all the things that
      are going to happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are lucky, you know. Lordy bless the American Express.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my job.&rdquo; She smiles and he winces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ollie, <i>dear</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so damn silly,&rdquo; says Oliver muffledly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of us. But now it doesn't matter. And we're both of us going to work
      and be very efficient at it&mdash;only now we'll have time and together
      and Paris to do all the things we really wanted to do. You <i>are</i>
      going to be a great novelist, Oliver, you know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you're going to be the foremost etcher&mdash;or etcheress&mdash;since
      Whistler&mdash;there. But, oh, Nancy, I don't care if I write great novels&mdash;or
      any novels&mdash;or anything else&mdash;just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She mocks him pleasantly. &ldquo;Why, Ollie, Ollie, Your Art?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>damn</i> my art&mdash;I mean&mdash;well, I don't quite mean that.
      But this is life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as large and twice as natural,&rdquo; says Nancy quoting, but for once
      Oliver is too interested with living to be literary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; he says, with an odd shakiness, an odd triumph, &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; and his
      arms go round her shoulders.
    </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
